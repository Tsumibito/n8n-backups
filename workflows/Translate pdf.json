To Dan, who supported me along the way both the first and second time\naround and encouraged me to go to college so I could be a boat washer with a\nbusiness degree. To Lee, who has put in so many hours of hard work and helped\ntake a huge load off my plate so I can have lunch with my sister almost daily, and\nwho somehow puts up with me even during my most crazed moments at the boat\nshows. And to Bill King of Compass Point Yachts, who gave a new detailer a chance\nand helped my business grow over the years.

I\nknow you’re anxious to get started, but let’s ease into this. There’s a lot to learn if you\nhaven’t done this before or if you’re looking for better, more effective techniques.\nThere are tips and tricks sprinkled throughout each chapter that can ease the job\nof cleaning and detailing your boat and make the work more pleasant. There will\nbe time for all of that, but first allow me to introduce myself and this book.\nWhy I Wrote This Book\nI used to think it was fun to hang out in the boat-cleaning aisle of my local boating\nsupply store and watch unsuspecting boaters stare with glazed expressions at the\noverwhelming array of products calling out to them from the floor-to-ceiling shelf\ndisplays. “No need to buff!” or “Lasts for seven years!” the cans and packaging pro-\nclaim—or my personal favorite, “Never need to wax your boat again!” Eventually\nI’d decide to help my fellow boaters, but more often than not, before I could swoop\nin to save the shopper from buying five products that don’t work and suggest the\none that does, a sales associate would spot his victim and saunter over. When I\npicture this scene, the associate is always a 17-year-old kid who has never cleaned\na boat and is working there only because his dad wants the store’s employee dis-\ncount. “Oh yeah,” the kid says. “That’s my favorite product, and it works great on\nevery type of boat and for every kind of stain. And it lasts for seven years.”\n\nxii Introduction\nThat is why I wrote this book—to help you when you’re standing in that aisle,\nand to go on helping you when you’re aboard your boat, maintenance tools and\nsupplies at the ready. I wrote it to share what I have learned from working in this\nindustry all these years, and to pass along some helpful tips and tricks so you can\nlearn from my experience rather than your own trials and errors. I wrote this book\nso you have the information you need at hand to care for your boat, whether it’s\nnew or used, whether it’s your first boat or your tenth, whether you maintain your\nboat yourself or hire a detailer.\nRain Is What I Know\nI live in the Pacific Northwest, so although I’ve included information about boat\ncleaning in any locale or climate, you may notice that my experience comes from\nwhat I know—gray skies, clean water, and lots of rain. Before researching this book, I\nhad no idea that folks in Florida have to use water filters and softeners or that South-\nern California boaters don’t have to cope with water streaks that reappear on an\nalmost daily basis. Also, my experience is mostly with fiberglass boats. Most owners\nof wooden boats prefer to do their own work, so although I love wooden boats, I have\nnot yet had enough experience with them to consider myself an expert.\nYou will encounter references to “Opening Day.” Here in the Pacific North-\nwest we generally put our boats away for the winter because of the cooler tempera-\ntures, rough seas, and rainy days. Come March and April, the rain lets up (a little),\nand we all come out of hibernation to start preparing for boating season, which we\njoyously ring in on May 1—or, as we call it, Opening Day.\nThis Book Is Written for . . .\n \nNew boat owners who have never previously owned a boat\n \nVeteran boat owners who have never maintained their boats but now want\nto start because the work looks enjoyable, or because there’s no better way\nto get to know your boat than by working on it, or because they want to\nsave money\n \nBoat owners who want to hire a detailer to do the work but need a manual\nto tell them what a detailer should or shouldn’t do\n \nOwners of boat-detailing companies who want to provide employees with\na guidebook\n\nIntroduction xiii\nIf you’re already an expert professional boat detailer, you will see that I don’t pro-\nvide every last tip and trick. When you work in the industry long enough, you come\nacross interesting fixes for almost every boat detailing conundrum, no matter how\nobscure. However, not all such fixes are appropriate for those who are less expe-\nrienced with gelcoat properties, chemical reactions, or how to remedy the situa-\ntion when they’ve accidentally confused the container of pink antifreeze for the\ncontainer of pink boat soap. For a book like this one, the tried and tested basics\nare best. The techniques in these pages cover every common scenario and many\nuncommon ones, and you’ll learn other shortcuts and secrets naturally along the\nway. (Here’s one for you: Don’t keep the pink antifreeze next to the pink boat soap.\nNot that we’ve ever done this before, of course. . . .)\nIn summary, this book lays a solid and safe groundwork for cleaning and\ndetailing your boat. It is written above all for the boatowner who has to care for\nonly one or maybe two boats, rather than the boat maintenance worker whose job\nis to care for seventy boats.\nNot All Boats Are Broads\nI’m not one of those people who refers to every boat as a “she” because I’m not\ncompletely convinced that all boats are of the female persuasion. I have met many\na boat with sharply angled features that won’t go in the right direction without\nsensible guidance and that seems to attract dirt. Such boats are obviously male.\nLikewise, I have met many a boat with beautiful curves and lines that is extremely\nstubborn when it comes to stain removal and that won’t stop squeaking or creak-\ning when worked on. Those boats are obviously female. So, at least until I learn a\nboat’s personality, it remains an “it” to me.\nInstructions Are for Others\nI’m the type of person who thinks instructions are for others—which is prob-\nably why my cooking never turns out very well. You can be assured that I have\nnot simply filled my chapters with rewritten instructions from cleaner, wax, and\nsoap containers and called that good. That’s because I’ve never really read those\ninstructions—I’ve merely glanced at them and then figured out better ways to use\nthe products. Just as you might change a recipe by adding your own favorite ingre-\ndients or cooking it differently, I use boat cleaning products in combination with\n\nxiv Introduction\nmy own preferred cleaning tools and techniques to achieve the results I’m looking\nfor. You can have confidence in the instructions I give for using each product; how-\never, if you’re ever in doubt or don’t have this book in front of you, the instructions\non the back of the bottle won’t let you down.\nI hope you will enjoy this book, learn from it, and keep it as a practical reference\nguide for as long as your heart belongs to your boat.\n\nTHE INSIDER’S GUIDE TO\nBOAT\nCLEANING\nAND\nDETAILING\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\n1\nC h A p t e r \n1\nWashing Your Boat\nIt’s finally a beautiful spring day and you decide to head down to your boat to get\nthe engines running or take it out for a spin. But what you see when you get there\ncauses shock and awe. Your boat is heavily dusted with a brown layer of dirt. Foot-\nprints from your last outing of the previous year remain on the nonskid. Some-\nthing slimy and green is oozing out of the rubrail. The gloss on your hull is missing.\nThe gelcoat is covered with water stains. And worst of all, it looks like entire bird\ncolonies have been dive-bombing your boat (and only your boat) all winter long.\nA boat covered in mildew after a long winter’s nap\n\n2 The Insider’s Guide to Boat Cleaning and Detailing\nWashing your boat—preferably on a regular basis—is an important task of\nboat ownership. It should be an enjoyable task, and I can assure you that when\nyou have the right gear and products on hand and know exactly how to tackle this\njob, you’ll find it peaceful and easy work. How many other ways can you think\nof to experience nature, fresh air, a peaceful environment, and healthy exercise\nwhile accomplishing useful work with results that are immediately and gratify-\ningly obvious?\nThis chapter covers the following topics:\n \nWhy you should wash your boat\n \nHow often to wash your boat\n \nGear and supplies needed\n \nPreparation\n \nHow and where to start\n \nRemoving water streaks\n \nTreating mildew\n \nWashing the tender\n \nKeeping your boat clean on a regular basis\nWhy Wash Your Boat?\nThis seems like an easy question with an easy answer. Why wash your boat? To\nget it clean. But there’s more to it than that, and more to it than meets the eye. To\nanswer a question with another question, what will happen to your gelcoat if dirt,\nairborne particles, stains, and moisture are allowed to remain on it for long peri-\nods of time? The answer is that these agents start to break down the integrity of the\ngelcoat. A brand-new boat with a nice glossy finish can look dull and faded within\na year if it isn’t washed on a fairly regular basis. Of course, the best way to protect a\ngelcoat finish is to wax the boat once or twice a year (covered in the next chapter),\nbut regular washings can help prolong the gelcoat’s appearance and protection.\nSmall airborne particles of dirt land constantly on the hull and decks. Unless\nyou wash your boat regularly to remove this layer of dirt, you are basically grinding\nit into nonskid deck surfaces and scratching the gelcoat with it as you walk around\nyour boat and brush against the side of the house structure and elsewhere. Like-\nwise, if your fenders or lines sit on or rub over any section of the gelcoat, they will\ngrind in dirt particles and leave marks in those areas.\n\nWashing Your Boat 3\nBird and spider droppings, if not washed off regularly, will eventually stain\nthe gelcoat. If your boat is docked near a tree, sap may fall onto the gelcoat, creat-\ning a sticky residue that attracts dirt and other particles. Any rainwater or moisture\nthat does not bead off the gelcoat but instead remains standing on the finish will\neventually cause mildew growth. Salt spray that remains on the gelcoat or windows\nwill eventually etch into the finish, especially if the boat sits in direct sunlight.\nOver time, your once glossy gelcoat finish will fade, becoming lightly scratched\nin high-traffic areas and acquiring light brown stains from droppings that have\nsoaked into the finish.\nThere are some maintenance tasks on a boat that, if left unattended to, will\nonly cause expensive repairs in the future. I’m not going to go so far as to say that\na failure to wash your boat on a regular basis will actually do any major damage.\nNo boat will ever sink from too heavy a cargo of dirt, bird droppings, and oxida-\ntion. (Thank goodness!) If your boat is not washed on a regular basis, however,\nthe cleaning you will eventually have to do to get the boat looking good again will\nbecome a much larger job than necessary. Further, once bird droppings or water\nstains have soaked into the gelcoat, a simple wash will no longer remove the stains.\nYour only option to remove the stains at this point is to wax your boat, which can\nbe costly and time-consuming and require a lot of hard physical work.\nAdditionally, keeping your boat washed and detailed on a regular basis will\ndefinitely help its eventual resale value. A clean boat shows a prospective buyer that\nthe owner cares about its appearance, and such an owner probably cares for the\nboat in other ways as well. A clean boat is likely to be a well-maintained boat, and\na dirty boat is hardly ever well maintained. Boat brokers typically refuse to show a\ndirty boat and will request that you wash your boat or have it detailed before they’ll\nshow it to prospective buyers. If you are planning to sell your boat, read more about\nhow to prepare it for sale in Appendix A, “Selling Your Boat.”\nHow Often to Wash Your Boat\nYou should wash your boat or have it washed by a detailer at least once every couple\nof weeks, and hose it off with fresh water after any saltwater excursion. You can go\nlonger between washes if you keep a good coat of wax on your boat or if you moor it\nin a covered slip. But if your boat is not in a covered slip, if you take it out often on\nsalt water, or if you moor it in a wet location (for example, the Pacific Northwest),\nyou should wash it every two to three weeks. Obviously, the more often you wash\n\n4 The Insider’s Guide to Boat Cleaning and Detailing\nyour boat, the better, provided you’re using good products and supplies (covered\nin the next section) that won’t strip the wax off the gelcoat. If you wash your boat\nregularly, it won’t get so dirty that washing it becomes an odious task. After a cer-\ntain point, dirty boats just get dirtier. Don’t let your boat reach that point.\nGear and Supplies\nIf you’ve owned a boat for a long time, you probably have a dock box full of half\nused cleaning products you bought over the years that promised magical results.\nNow would be a good time to go through those products and throw out any that\nare almost empty or look old. Also throw out any cleaners in containers that have\ncracked, rusted, or ripped. You can be sure that the integrity of the cleaning prod-\nuct has deteriorated, and there’s no reason to handle rusty cans or sharp edges.\nTake the Turtle Wax, dish soap, and any other auto or household cleaning prod-\nucts back to the garage, and find another use for any cleaning products that aren’t\nbiodegradable or meant specifically for marine use. You’ll probably be left with an\nassortment of colorful boat soaps, cracking paste waxes, and spray products from\ncompanies who can’t seem to spell correctly (“Brite” and “Klean”) that promise to\nremove any stain that even thinks about coming near your boat. If your half-used\nboat-specific products are no more than two years old and have been properly\nsealed in containers that show no signs of wear and tear, consider them usable.\nA few household cleaners are useful on the exterior of a boat, and I mention those\nin this section, but they should be used sparingly and wiped on and wiped off (as\nopposed to being hosed off) if possible.\nA Short Lesson on “Biodegradable”\nMost of the boat cleaning and washing products you’ll find at a boating supply\nstore say “biodegradable” on them. This simply means that these products are\ncapable of being decomposed by biological agents in the water, such as bacteria.\nA biodegradable product like boat soap will eventually “break down” in the water,\nwhereas a nonbiodegradable product (such as oil) will remain in its current state\nor form. Still, biodegradable products can kill or sicken waterfowl and fish. This is\nbecause most soaps and other cleaning agents contain phosphates, which encour-\nage excess plant growth.\n\nWashing Your Boat 5\nWhile small amounts of phosphates constitute a beneficial nutrient (they\nencourage excess plant growth) and are necessary for photosynthesis, large\namounts biodegrade slowly, and their effects are felt for a long time. Excess phos-\nphates increase the acidity of the water and speed up the growth of algae. Algae in\nnormal quantities is the essential base of the aquatic food chain, but algae blooms\nblock light and choke water flow, making it difficult for other living organisms\n(both plants and fish) to exist in that environment. In essence, such blooms slowly\nsuffocate the creatures living in the area. You might think an algae bloom, through\nphotosynthesis, would increase the dissolved oxygen in the water, but in fact the\nopposite occurs. Dead and decaying plant material use up the available oxygen.\nAny marine organisms that can escape the area do so, and the rest die. This local\ncatastrophe is familiar to anyone who has lived beside a eutrophic lake, but marine\nwaters are not immune.\nSoaps and Stain Removers\nI’m the first to admit that the best soap for washing pretty much anything, includ-\ning a boat, is good ole dish soap. Who doesn’t appreciate all of those hardworking\nsuds and a lemon-fresh scent? And it’s tempting to use dish soap, because we all\nown plenty of it, it’s easily portable, and a little goes a long way. But whatever you\ndo, please don’t wash your boat with dish soap . . . or Soft Scrub . . . or Ajax . . .\nor Windex. These products may be excellent choices for their intended uses, but\nnot for washing a boat. Leave your household cleaners at home, or at least most of\nthem. I list those that can be helpful in the appropriate section, but first here is a\nlist of household cleaners that should not be used on your boat. All of these are in\ncommon use on boats, but none of them should be. The last column is a list of what\nto use instead, and I go into more detail on each of those products below.\nCleaning Activity\nHousehold\nProduct Why Not to Use Use Instead\nWashing boat Dish soap Causes hazing and removes\nwax over time.\nBoat soap\nRemoving marks or\nstains on gelcoat\nSoft Scrub Scratches gelcoat and removes\nwax.\nWax\ncontinued\n\n6 The Insider’s Guide to Boat Cleaning and Detailing\nCleaning Activity\nHousehold\nProduct Why Not to Use Use Instead\nCleaning nonskid or\nvinyl surfaces\nAjax or Soft Scrub Leaves a powdery residue to\nclean up and can scratch vinyl\nfinish.\nMagic pad, Black\nStreak Remover\nCleaning windows Windex Streaks and causes hazing on\nLexan.\nSprayway or\nMer-maids\nRemoving stains on\ngelcoat\nFantastik or similar\nall-purpose cleaner\nContains harsh chemicals,\ncauses yellowing of gelcoat,\nand removes wax.\nSimple Green or\nKrazy Clean\nWashing boat,\ncleaning stains\nCar soap and spray\ncleaners\nMeant for clear coat and might\nnot be biodegradable.\nSoap and spray\ncleaners from boat\nsupply stores\nRemoving brown\nalgae stains\nSoft Scrub,\nrubbing compound\nToo harsh on gelcoat.

All boat\nsoaps on the market are required to be biodegradable, and most contain an agent\nthat creates suds. Some contain wax. Many are pink. You shouldn’t choose a soap\nby its color, but neither should you choose one by what the back of the bottle says\nit can do for your boat. They all help to get the dirt off your boat, but only because\nyou’re standing behind the deck brush moving it back and forth. None of them do\nthe work for you. (I swear I have found a few brands of soap that actually say the\nsoap will do all of the work. If that were the case, I’d squirt the soap all over my\nhouse, truck, and horse and then go have a seat and watch them get clean!)\nI have tried boat soaps that cost $21 per gallon and boat soaps that cost $4.99\nper gallon. The more expensive ones lasted longer as more water was added to the\nbucket, but that really benefits only a detailer washing seven boats in a row or an\nowner washing a boat that is 50 feet long or longer. The most expensive boat soap\nI’ve used smelled good and contained a light wax agent. The least expensive did a\ngood job of removing dirt and most stains, also contained a wax, and maintained\nits suds long enough to be effective. I have also used soaps meant for automobiles,\n\nWashing Your Boat 7\nand they worked just as well and were\noften much less expensive than soaps\nmarketed specifically for boats.\nBoat soaps with wax don’t actually\nadd a coat of wax to the gelcoat. Your\nboat won’t bead up or look more glossy\nthan it did before you washed it. The\npurpose of waxing a boat is to remove\noxidation and protect the gelcoat from\nharmful ultraviolet (UV) rays and other\nelements. The only way to remove oxi-\ndation is to cut through the top layer of\ngelcoat with a rubbing compound, pref-\nerably using a buffer, and no soap will\ndo that. The main benefit of a boat soap containing wax is that, at the very least,\nit won’t strip any wax from the gelcoat (as a harsher soap such as dish soap would\ndo), and at the very most it might add a thin layer of a UV-protecting agent to the\ngelcoat to slow the oxidation process. But don’t depend on boat soap to stop oxida-\ntion in its tracks. That is the full-time job of a good coat of wax.\nI have seen many boat owners use Soft Scrub to remove a stain or mark (such\nas bird or spider droppings, a scuff mark made by black-soled shoes, a grease or food\nstain, or water stains) from a section of smooth gelcoat. And why wouldn’t they? This\npaste-like product does the job! But it also removes wax and can scratch gelcoat,\nthus making that section more susceptible to future staining and oxidation. From a\ncosmetic standpoint, if your boat is fairly glossy, any area you clean with Soft Scrub\nwill stand out glaringly before long because it will look much more faded than the\nsurrounding gelcoat. Soft Scrub also leaves a powdery or gritty residue, even after\nbeing hosed off. That fine layer of grit will be ground into the gelcoat as you walk on\nit or rub past it, slowly deteriorating the coat of wax on the gelcoat. The best product\nto use for stains that don’t come off with soap and water is a cleaner wax, which is\nwax that has a rubbing compound mixed into it. The next chapter covers all you\nneed to know about using wax to clean and protect your boat.\nI would also advise against using Soft Scrub or other abrasive powder clean-\ners such as Ajax on vinyl fabrics and nonskid decks. Instead, I often use the Mr.\nClean Magic Eraser pad (Extra Power), which you can buy at most grocery or\nNote: There are many different brands of boat\nsoap and cleaners on the market. I live on the West\nCoast and am most familiar with the brands that are\npopular there. Usually I focus on what to look for in a\nparticular product or piece of equipment rather than\ntouting specific brands. Keep in mind that there are\nmany specialized brands out there that may not even\nmake it to the shelf of your local boat supply store\nyet might be superior to what is mass-marketed. As\nlong as a product is meant for boats or gelcoat, is\nbiodegradable, and doesn’t contain drying agents\nsuch as alcohol or acetone, there’s no reason not to\ngive it a try for its intended purpose on your boat.\n\n8 The Insider’s Guide to Boat Cleaning and Detailing\nhousehold variety stores. But I must warn you of a few very important things before\nusing a Magic Eraser on your boat. First, it can be very addicting. Second, it can be\nharmful. The Magic Eraser is like an extremely mild SOS pad or a very soft pumice\nstone—which is to say that it’s constructed of a very fine abrasive (what Procter\n& Gamble calls “microbristles”), and this, rather than a chemical agent, is what\nmakes it effective. And it does such a great job of removing marks and stains that\nyou’ll want to use it on every surface of your boat. This is why it’s so addictive.\nThe reason why it’s so harmful is because using it is almost the equivalent of wet-\nsanding the gelcoat. It will surely remove any stain or mark you’re trying to clean,\nbut it will also remove a light layer of\ngelcoat and leave you with a dull sec-\ntion that is no longer protected by wax.\nUse mag ic pads to clea n on ly\nnonskid vinyl and rubber. Never use\na Mag ic Eraser or ot her mag ic pad\nto clean a stain or a mark on smooth\ngelcoat unless you plan to reapply wax\nto that section. When nonskid starts to\nlook gray or you see grease stains that\ndon’t come out, lightly run a wet magic\npad over the nonskid. You can use a\nspray cleaner like Simple Green if the\nstain has been there for a while and\ndoesn’t come out with a first pass, but a\nwet magic pad should take care of most\nstains and marks. If your vinyl seats\nare looking gray or have stains on them, spray them with Black Streak Remover,\nthen evenly wipe them with the magic pad. Hose off the seats and they’ll look new\nagain. You can also use a magic pad to clean the shore-power cord or the rubber\npontoons on your tender.\nNext on the list are products that are good for cleaning windows—be they\nrigid portlights or deckhouse windows of glass, Lexan, or Plexiglas, or flexible boat-\ncurtain windows of Isenglass or Strataglass. I don’t recommend using a product\nlike Windex because it can cause hazing on most of these materials. A household\nproduct that is often used on boats and does an excellent job is a window cleaner\ncalled Sprayway Glass Cleaner. It doesn’t streak or cause hazing and can be used on\nThe Magic Eraser pad is ideal for cleaning power cords\nand other rubberized items.\n\nWashing Your Boat 9\nall surfaces and materials, including Lexan, Isenglass, and wood veneers. Another\ngood window cleaner is Mer-maids Plastic Cleaner. It is made specifically for boat\nwindows of all materials and doesn’t streak or leave a haze. I go into more detail on\nwindows in Chapter 6—Canvas, Carpet, Vinyl, and Plastic Windows.\nSometimes it’s handy to have a spray cleaner that you can use to wipe off\nwater or bird-dropping stains between washes. The best spray cleaners I’ve found\nfor this purpose are Simple Green (or Simple Green Marine), Black Streak Remover,\nand Krazy Clean. Avoid all-around spray cleaners like Fantastik because they cause\nyellowing of the gelcoat. Simple Green is less expensive at grocery or variety stores\nthan at boat supply stores. Krazy Clean and Black Streak Remover are sold only\nat boat supply stores. Simple Green is the most environmentally friendly of the\ntrio, but if you’re spraying the cleaner on your boat and wiping it off (as opposed\nto hosing it off into the water), you can use Krazy Clean or Black Streak Remover\non extra-stubborn stains. Most spray cleaners, however, should not be sprayed\ndirectly onto gelcoat because they may cause yellowing. Spray the cleaner onto\na rag or a soft brush, then apply to the gelcoat, following up with a clean, dry rag\nto remove the cleaner. Avoid doing this type of cleaning (spray and wipe) in direct\nsunlight, where it may cause streaks or temporary discoloration in the gelcoat.\nRags and Squeegees\nMicrofiber rags are the best type to use on almost every area and finish on your\nboat. You can buy a large pack of them at a bulk variety store such as Costco or\nSam’s Club. Walmart also carries large packs for a good price. Most boat supply\nstores sell them, but you’ll pay a lot more for a smaller pack. Microfiber rags are\nsmooth, extremely absorbent, and long lasting, and they allow you to apply an even\npressure when wiping or buffing something off. You can wash them over and over\nagain, but do not use a fabric softener of any kind with them. They’ll lose all absor-\nbency and will cause streaking when used to wipe windows or mirrors. Terrycloth\ntowels are not the best choice for removing cleaning products (spray cleaners or\nwax) because they aren’t very absorbent, they wear out after several washes, and\nthey don’t provide an even pressure when wiping because of their piled surface.\nOlder terrycloth towels can also lightly scratch fine surfaces. And you never want\nto use a terrycloth towel (new or old) on plastic windows.\nThe best squeegee I’ve used is the California Water Blade. You can find it at\nboat and auto supply stores and most household variety stores. Buy the larger rect-\n\n10 The Insider’s Guide to Boat Cleaning and Detailing\nangular blade (it usually has a purple handle) rather than the smaller blade with\nangled corners. One pass over the gelcoat or a window removes all water. It’s easy\nto use correctly and won’t hurt your wrist even after squeegeeing your whole boat.\nYou will rarely have to follow up with a rag after using the Water Blade on gelcoat or\nwindows, but if you do, use a microfiber rag. One rag is most likely all you’ll need,\nbecause the squeegee will remove most of the water.\nBrushes\nIf you want to give your boat a thorough wash (for example, cleaning all surface\nareas, nooks and crannies, hatch gutters, and drainage holes), you’ll need four\ntypes of brushes: two deck brushes with soft and coarse brush heads that attach to\na long handle, and two hand brushes with soft and coarse brush heads.\nMake sure the long pole handle is made of aluminum so it’s lightweight and\nfloats. Long deck brush handles can be fairly expensive at boat supply stores, and\nthe last thing you want is to watch yours sink straight to the bottom of the lake or\nharbor when you accidentally drop it overboard. You need to buy only one handle;\nthe deck brush heads are detachable so you can swap between them. One soft and\none coarse brush head will cover the majority of boat washing chores.\nThe soft head should be soft enough that it doesn’t feel scratchy when you\nrun it over your face. This is the brush to use on all smooth gelcoat. If you’re using\nShurhold products, the blue brush head is their soft brush; West Marine’s soft brush\nis yellow. Again, if a brush is soft enough for your face, it’s soft enough for smooth\ngelcoat.\nMost deck brushes come in a medium-grade coarse and a heavy-grade coarse.\nThere is no reason to buy both because the medium grade is coarse enough and\nis all you’ll need. This is what you’ll use on nonskid and possibly when trying to\nremove waterline scum that a soft deck brush won’t touch. Shurhold’s medium-\ncoarse brush head is yellow. (The white one is their heavy-grade coarse.) West\nMarine’s medium-coarse brush head is blue.\nThe remaining brushes you’ll need are smaller hand brushes for hard-to-\nreach places or for use on narrow side decks or walkways where a deck brush\nattached to a long pole would be awkward. Here, too, you should have a soft one for\n\nWashing Your Boat 11\nsmooth gelcoat and a coarse one for nonskid surfaces. You can buy these brushes\nin the household cleaning or auto section of most stores.\nWater Filters and Softeners\nIf you want a spot-free boat when you’re done washing it, or if you moor your boat\nin an area with hard water that leaves mineral deposits and other particles that\nproduce spots, you may want to consider buying an in-line water filter and/or\nwater softener. The culprit is not the water itself; rather it’s all the minerals that\nexist in every drop of water. These minerals remain on paint or gelcoat long after\nthe water has evaporated, etching permanent spots into the finish. Minerals, par-\nticularly calcium and magnesium, are what make water “hard.” The calcium and\nmagnesium actually harden into deposits called “scale” inside pipes and on other\nsurfaces, including your boat. The only way to avoid such deposits is with a water\nUse a hand brush in places where balancing with a heavier long-poled brush is too difficult.\n\n12 The Insider’s Guide to Boat Cleaning and Detailing\nsoftener. It works by replacing the calcium and magnesium ions with sodium ions,\nwhich are “soft” and don’t produce scale or stains. Sodium ions make the water feel\n“slippery,” and this causes it to sheet off surfaces more effectively; any water that\nremains on the boat’s finish will not leave spots.\nSediment is rust or sand inside freshwater supply pipes. A broken water main\nmiles away from your hose can allow sand to enter your water supply. Likewise, a\nlittle rust anywhere along the line can flake off into the water and pass through\nyour hose. A sediment filter traps fine sediment as the water passes through so\nthat nothing hits your boat but pure water. If you don’t have a hard water prob-\nlem, you may not need a water filter attached to your hose, although having one\nwould reduce any sort of water spotting and make attaining a spot-free boat much\neasier.\nIn-line water filters can run from $50 to several hundred dollars. If you need\none only for washing your own boat, the less expensive models will work fine.\nYou’ll simply need to add more salts or replace the filter every so often, depending\non how much you use it. You can search the Internet for an “in-line hose filter” to\nlearn more about your options, and you can purchase filters through most auto\ndetailing stores or websites.\nOther Cleaning Gear\nYou might think that hoses and nozzles are self-explanatory, yet there are several\nissues to consider. Your good ole garden hose from home isn’t the best type to use\naround your boat, simply because garden hoses are fairly stiff and thus difficult\nto coil and store in a small space. I equip my crew with a typical \n5\n⁄ 8 -inch-diameter\nround green multipurpose hose. Make sure your hose is 20 to 30 feet longer than\nyour boat so it will reach easily from the spigot to the far side of your deckhouse\nor the far corner of your flybridge. Also, be sure to clean the outside of your hose\nevery now and then so it doesn’t leave marks on your boat, especially if the hose\nhas come in contact with a creosote piling.\nPlastic nozzles are better for our purposes than heavy-duty metal ones. Not\nonly are they cheaper, they won’t leave scratch marks when inadvertently dropped\non deck and won’t sink if accidentally knocked overboard.\nYou’ll need a bucket, of course. Any 3- or 5-gallon bucket will do. ‘Nuff said.\n\nWashing Your Boat 13\nCleaning Gear and Supplies Checklist\nHere is a quick checklist you can take to the store or consult to make sure you have\neverything you need on your boat or in your dock box:\n \nBucket, multipurpose hose, and plastic nozzle\n \nOne or two long deck brush poles\n \nSoft deck brush attachment and medium-coarse deck brush attachment\n \nSoft hand brush and coarse hand brush\n \nMicrofiber rags and/or a squeegee\n \nBoat soap\n \nMr. Clean Magic Eraser pads (Extra Power)\n \nStain remover spray such as Simple Green, Black Streak Remover, or Krazy\nClean to remove stubborn stains\n \nWindow cleaner spray such as Sprayway Glass Cleaner or Mer-maids Plas-\ntic Cleaner to clean glass or plastic windows\n \nMildew remover spray such as Tilex or Lysol\nPreparation\nOnce you have the gear and supplies you need for washing your boat, there are a\nfew other items you’ll want to consider to make the job easier and safer.\nClothing\nMake sure you’re wearing comfortable clothing that will keep you warm or cool\nenough while you’re working. Layers are best, since you’ll warm up as you start\nworking. Clothing without a lot of zippers or rivets (on jeans) is best to avoid\nscratching smooth gelcoat surfaces as you brush against them. Tennis shoes or\ndeck shoes with good traction are best, but make sure the soles are non-marking or\nyou’ll be cleaning up after yourself from scuff marks everywhere you go. Polarized\nsunglasses cut the glare and will help you see stains or streaks that you might not\notherwise notice. Except in summer, I normally wash boats wearing rubber gloves.\nThey keep your hands warm and dry in colder weather and protect your hands\nfrom drying out after being wet for long periods of time.\n\n14 The Insider’s Guide to Boat Cleaning and Detailing\nSafety\nAs with all boating activities, washing and cleaning your boat require you to be\naware of your footing and maintain your balance and coordination. When a boat\nis wet and sudsy, it can also be slippery, even on the nonskid. Take your time and\nmove more slowly in wet and sudsy places. If backing up while washing an area,\npeek behind you to make sure you’re not about to trip on a step or cleat. If leaning\nagainst a railing, make sure it’s sturdy enough to hold you. And if it’s been a while\nsince you’ve done something that requires this much physical activity, take it slow\nand divide the boat into sections.\nGetting Started: Step-by-Step\nBefore you wet your boat with the hose, look over the smooth gelcoat areas for\nwater stains, black marks, and scuff marks. If these don’t come off or lighten when\nyou rub your finger over them, chances are a soft wash mitt and soap won’t faze\nthem either. If it’s been a while since you last washed your boat, spray Simple Green\nover those areas (this is the one cleaner you can spray directly on your boat with no\nworry that it will cause yellowing or discoloration) and let it soak in while you’re\nassembling the rest of your gear. By the time you are ready to wash those areas, the\nstreaks or stains should come off during the first pass.\nPour a capful or two of boat soap in a bucket and fill the bucket with water,\ntrying not to ingest the suds as the power of the hose sends them flying in your\nface. While you’re filling the bucket, mentally divide your boat into sections so the\njob of washing it doesn’t seem so overwhelming, especially if this is your boat’s\nspring cleaning. The sections might include the flybridge (or helm area), port side,\nstarboard side, bow, stern, and hull. Plan on taking a short break after each section\nif you need to. Always wash from the top down and from front to back. This way,\nthe water and dirt particles will drain down and aft as you’re cleaning, and you\nwon’t have to repeat any steps.\nStart hosing down the boat. This will at least remove the first layer of bird\ndroppings, dust, loose dirt in the nonskid, and leaves or other natural debris. If your\nboat hasn’t been washed in a long time (more than three months), you may need to\nwash and scrub certain areas twice. If the soap isn’t cutting through the dirt and\nthe Simple Green didn’t remove a stubborn stain, you can try a slightly stronger\nspray cleaner like Black Streak Remover or Krazy Clean. Spray the product directly\n\nWashing Your Boat 15\nonto your brush, not the boat, to pre-\nvent yellowing. Use the soft brushes on\nthe smooth gelcoat and the medium-\ncoarse brushes on the nonskid.\nTo really get your nonskid clean,\nhose it dow n and use the medium-\ncoarse deck brush with the long handle\nto remove the dirt. You may have to\nscrub the nonskid in multiple direc-\ntions or in small circles to get the brush\nbristles into the tiny nonskid valleys.\nIf soap and water don’t do the job, try\nusing the Mr. Clean Magic Eraser pad\nwith water or a spray cleaner to remove\ntough sta ins, such as g rease, scuf f\nmarks, blood, and stains from bird or spider droppings.\nDon’t forget to lift up the hatches and clean their tracks and gutters. If you\nhaven’t washed your boat for several months, leaves or other debris might be caus-\ning a backup in the deck drainage. If a drain is clogged, place your hose nozzle into\nthe mouth of the drain and spray at full pressure for 30 to 60 seconds. This should\npush debris through the drain and unclog it.\nFallen leaves and leaf parts can easily clog drains.Hosing out a clogged drain\nNote: You can use your soft deck or hand brush on\nwindows to get them clean, but be sure to quickly\nrinse well so soap streaks don’t set in, especially if\nyou’re washing in direct sunlight or on a warm day.\nFollow up by using a squeegee to remove drops of\nwater and prevent water spots.\nDo not use any of your brushes, even the soft\nones, to wash plastic windows. It doesn’t take\nmuch to permanently scratch these materials, and\nmost deck brushes aren’t soft enough. Hose off the\nplastic windows each time you wash your boat; then\nwipe them clean with a microfiber cloth. Chapter\n6, “Canvas, Carpet, Vinyl, and Plastic Windows,”\noffers more detailed information on keeping plastic\nwindows clean and scratch-free.\n\n16 The Insider’s Guide to Boat Cleaning and Detailing\nOnce you have washed your boat’s superstructure and decks, you’re ready to\nwash the hull. If you’re lucky enough to have a dock on both sides of your boat, this\ntask will be easy. If there’s a dock on only one side, however, you can still reach a\ngood portion of the hull on the other side but most likely not all of it—unless you\nuse a dinghy. I advise my customers to turn their boat in its berth every now and\nthen so my crew can more thoroughly wash the other side. To reach the far side of\nthe hull from the deck, make sure you can safely lean against your railing. Take\nthe long-handled pole brush with the soft deck brush attachment and carefully\nlean over the railing to wash the hull. Don’t try to reach every inch of it, because\nthe chances of ending up in the water increase the farther you lean. The hose spray\nwill easily reach what you can’t, and hosing off the hull is better than nothing,\nespecially if your boat has salt on it.\nOnce you’ve washed the outboard side of the hull from the deck, step down\nto the dock with your gear to wash the\ndock side. This should be easy, because\nyou’l l f i na l ly be able to st a nd up\nstraight. If scum on the waterline does\nnot come off with the soft deck brush,\ntr y using the medium-coarse brush\nthere. If there are brown algae stains\nStubborn brown algae stains\nTip: Don’t leave your boat soapy for long, especially\non a sunny day, or the soap will leave streak marks\neven after it’s hosed off. If you want a streak-\nfree finish, rinse often and thoroughly and use a\nsqueegee, a microfiber rag, or a chamois to dry the\nboat after washing it.\n\nWashing Your Boat 17\non the hull, spray the area with Rust SprayAway, use the soft deck brush to wipe it\naround, then hose it off thoroughly.\nStains That Discolor Gelcoat\nYou may come across a few stains or marks that do not come out with soap and\nwater or the stronger spray cleaners. These might include bird dropping residue,\ngray water stains (from dirty water or acid rain), yellow or purple marks left by\nfallen leaves, and other such stains that discolor the gelcoat. If a stain doesn’t come\noff after three tries with my usual cleaners, I leave it for later and continue washing\nthe rest of the boat. Removing stains like that requires a different set of products.\nBird droppings and leaves typically produce a red, yellow, or purple discolor-\nation on your gelcoat. Things can get really messy in the fall when birds have been\nfeasting on berries, turning your otherwise clean boat into a Picasso masterpiece.\nOnce you’ve washed your boat to remove the top layer of dirt and as many of the\nleaves and bird droppings as will come off, head to your dock box to grab a Mr.\nClean Magic Eraser pad, a bottle of cleaner wax, and a microfiber rag. I go into\nmore detail about waxing your boat in the next chapter, but for now we need some\nwax to help remove these stubborn stains.\nWet a magic pad and lightly scrub the stained area to take out the discol-\noration. This will help remove the thin layer of gelcoat that the stain is sitting on\nas well as any wax in that area. Most of the stain will disappear, but not all of it.\nYou’ll be left with a much lighter stain. At this point, you can do one of two things.\nYou can leave it for a few days while the sun bleaches it out, or you can continue\nto remove the stain with cleaner wax. If you choose the latter, pour a small circle\nof cleaner wax onto the stain and work it in with the microfiber rag until the stain\ncomes out. It will require hard pressure to remove the stain completely. Your stain\nis now gone, and that area is again protected with wax. If you chose to let the sun\nremove the stain for you, go back a few days later; if the stain is gone, apply a coat\nof wax to that area to protect it again.\nRemoving Acid Rain, Water Spots, and Streaks\nYou can try washing away water stains as many times as you like, but after each\nrain they will sneak their way back onto your boat, black streaks dripping down\neach side, making it look as if you never washed it. If it’s raining right now, water\n\n18 The Insider’s Guide to Boat Cleaning and Detailing\nstains are forming as you read this! Water stains can’t completely be avoided, but\nthey can be minimized, or the path of the water run-off can be redirected. This\nsection explains the different types of water stains, how they’re made, and how to\ntreat and prevent them.\nWater spots. Water spots are caused by water from the hose, rain, or salt spray sit-\nting on your boat’s gelcoat or windows. When that drop of water evaporates, it can\nleave behind mineral deposits or salt crystals, making a slight outline of the drop\nof water on that surface. On a hot, sunny day, the sun can bake that deposit into\ngelcoat, glass, or plastic, causing a water spot that can no longer be washed off.\nThis is very common if you don’t squeegee your windows dry after each wash or\ndrenching—and who can be available to do this every time it rains? Those water\nspots may need waxing and buffing to thoroughly remove them. Before going\nthrough the hassle of waxing those waters spots away, however, try washing your\nboat with white vinegar. The mineral deposits can sometimes be removed with\nan acidic substance, and white vinegar is the safest, cheapest, and most effective\nacid wash available. If that doesn’t work, see Chapter 2, which discusses waxing off\nthose stubborn water spots.\nAcid rain. You may come across gray streaks on your boat’s gelcoat that don’t look\nlike typical water stains (which are usually spotted grayish-black streaks) and\ndon’t come off when rubbed with your finger or washed with a soapy sponge. These\nstreaks might be caused by acid rain. Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides in the\natmosphere are the primary causes of acid rain. In the United States, about two-\nthirds of all sulfur dioxide and one-fourth of all nitrogen oxides come from elec-\ntric power generation that relies on burning fossil fuels like coal. Acid rain occurs\nwhen these gases react in the atmosphere with water, oxygen, and other chemicals\nto form various acidic compounds. The result is a mild solution of sulfuric acid and\nnitric acid in the rain. Don’t bother trying to wash the stains away or wax them off.\nThe sun will bleach them away as quickly as they were made. Trying to remove\nthem yourself with cleaners or rubbing compound will only remove the wax in\nthat area, and strong rubbing compound may remove a slight layer of gelcoat in the\nprocess. Best to let the sun do the job.\nWater streaks. A water streak, on the other hand, is a stain caused by the dirt, min-\nerals, and pollutants in water or rain that has penetrated into the gelcoat rather\n\nWashing Your Boat 19\nthan sitting on top of it. That’s why\nwater streaks don’t always wash away\neasily. These, as mentioned above,\nare the typical grayish-black streaks\nthat often run down the sides of the\nf lybridge and just below the rubrail.\nIf these streaks don’t come out after\nwashing the area with soap and water,\ntry spraying Simple Green or white vin-\negar to remove the stains they make.\nIf this doesn’t work, they’ll need to be\nwaxed away. I have detailed a few boats\nthat had such bad water stains that we\nhad to use heav y-duty rubbing com-\npound to remove them. One boat had not been waxed in several years and was not\nwashed on a regular basis. The water stains built up over time in localized places\nand “soaked” into the unprotected gelcoat. Water stains are so easily preventable\nthat there is no reason why they should ever get to that point. Keep your boat waxed\nand washed regularly, and nothing will soak in permanently.\nOne of the best ways to prevent water streaks is to redirect them so that water\nrunning down your boat drains somewhere other than onto the gelcoat. This is not\npossible with every water streak, but in some areas you might be able to attach a\nplastic tube to the end of a drainage route so the water drains off your boat rather\nthan down an edge or the side of your boat.\nTreating Mildew\nIn wet or humid climates, you will often find green mildew growing in rubrails,\non canvas, and even on smooth gelcoat, as well as black mildew (which looks like\nsmall black specs) in the nonskid. The best way to remove mildew from your boat\nis with a mildew cleaner spray such as Lysol or Tilex. These products are not made\nspecifically for boats and are far from biodegradable. In fact, the chemicals in them\nare so harsh that I suggest you wear rubber gloves when working with them and\ntry not to breathe the spray particles floating in the air. If the day is at all breezy,\nstand so the spray is blowing away from you. I often wear a face mask if I’m work-\ning on a large area or in an enclosed flybridge. The reason I suggest using this type\nWater stains after just a few hours of rain\n\n20 The Insider’s Guide to Boat Cleaning and Detailing\nof cleaner, which doesn’t meet any of my usual criteria for boat cleaning products,\nis because it works so well and makes the job a lot easier. If you can spray the prod-\nuct on and wipe it off with a rag, you’re not hurting the environment as much as\nyou would be if you used a brush and hosed it off. If you do have to use a brush and\nhose, rinse thoroughly to dilute the amount of mildew cleaner you used. A prod-\nuct called Mold Off (www.moldoff.org) treats and prevents mildew and is actually\nbiodegradable (and smells good). Although I have found it to work better on canvas\nthan on gelcoat or nonskid, it’s a more environmentally safe mildew killer than\nLysol Mildew Remover or Tilex Mold\nand Mildew Spray.\nOnce you’ve donned your rubber\ngloves and face mask, you’re ready to\nbegin. If the mold is in your nonskid,\ngenerously spray the surface with the\nmildew remover spray and let it soak in\nfor a few minutes.\nThen take your soft or medium-\ncoarse deck brush and brush it around\nover the nonskid. You can dip the brush\nin a bucket of soap and water, but you\ndon’t have to. When the mildew has dis-\nappeared, hose it off thoroughly. If you\nfind mildew on smooth gelcoat, simply\npour a little mildew spray in with the soap and water and wash your boat as you\nnormally would. If the mildew is on canvas, spray those areas with mildew remover\nspray, scrub the area with a soft brush, then hose it off. Mildew loves canvas, so\nmore mildew treatment and prevention tips for canvas appear in Chapter 6.\nWashing the Tender\nAll of the gear and supplies you use to wash your boat will work well for washing\nyour fiberglass dinghy. If you own an inflatable, however, you might also want to\npurchase a product aptly named Inflatable Boat Cleaner (or something similar that\nis created specifically for cleaning inflatable boats or rubber materials), especially\nif you haven’t washed your tender in a long time and there are black or gray streaks\nor stains on the rubber pontoons.\nBlack mold in nonskid\n\nWashing Your Boat 21\nAssuming your tender is out of the water (as it should be for proper storage)\nand hanging from a davit or sitting on V-bars, make sure the drain plug is out and\nfree of debris so all of the water you spray into the tender will easily drain out. Hose\nthe tender down completely and let the water run off. Then spray the boat cleaner\nall over the rubber pontoons and any vinyl seat cushions as well. Let the spray\nsit on those areas for one to two minutes. It will not discolor or further stain the\npontoons. Then scrub all areas of the rubber pontoons and vinyl seats with a soft\nor medium-coarse hand brush. This will work the product in and lift dirt, water\nstreaks, grease marks, and other stains. Once you’ve run the brush over all such\nareas, hose them off well. This will show you just how much dirt was removed, and\nwhether you’ll need to repeat the process to remove additional dirt and stains.\nTo remove stubborn water streaks or stains that don’t come off with a first pass,\ntry wiping or scrubbing the pontoons with a magic pad. This should remove most\nstreaks when used along with the Inflatable Boat Cleaner spray.\nWash a fiberglass dinghy the same way you washed the smooth gelcoat sec-\ntions of your boat—with a soft hand brush and soapy water. Rinse well. Then lift\nup seat cushions and open hatches and storage compartments and hose and scrub\nthem clean. When finished, dry the seat cushions and instrument dash area (if\nany) with a towel.\nKeeping Your Boat Clean on a Regular Basis\nIf you have no time and even less energy or enthusiasm for washing your boat after\na day of cruising or sailing, at least spend five minutes hosing it down to remove\nsalt spray, fresh bird droppings, Uncle Marvin’s spilled beer now dripping into the\nlazarette, footprint dirt in the nonskid, and the ketchup slowly running down your\nbrand-new Isenglass from Aunt Reba’s juicy hamburger. This will prevent these\nstains and dirt from setting, soaking, or baking in and will make your next wash\ngo a lot faster.\nI recommend washing your boat every couple of weeks—or once a month\nif you keep it in a covered slip. If you wash it on a regular basis, the water stains\nwill come off with soap and water and a swipe of your soft brush or mitt. No need\nto scrub harder or longer with special products. The bird droppings won’t have a\nchance to stain your gelcoat or canvas, and dirt and debris won’t get ground in to\nthe point of scratching the fiberglass or clogging deck drains.\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\n23\nC h A p t e r\nWaxing Your Boat\nI’m always amazed that so many owners of fiberglass boats fail to wax their boats\non a regular basis. This is the easiest, fastest, and cheapest way to protect your\nboat’s gelcoat from harmful UV rays and other elements, keep it cleaner longer,\nand keep that new, glossy look. It doesn’t matter if you keep your boat in a covered\nslip or if you’ve created a canvas tent to protect your baby from the elements—you\nstill need to wax your boat!\nBefore we get down to it, let’s begin with a quick overview of the surfaces\nwe’re protecting—fiberglass and gelcoat.\nA Brief Explanation of Fiberglass\nConstruction\nNinety-five percent of all pleasure boats manufactured during the past 40 years\nhave hulls and decks built of fiberglass-reinforced plastic (FRP), commonly known\nas fiberglass. Glass fibers provide most of the strength in the FRP matrix, and a\nplastic resin (usually polyester but sometimes vinylester or epoxy) provides the\nmedium within which the glass is deployed, shaped (while the resin is liquid), and\nultimately immobilized (when the resin cures into a solid). Fiberglass boats are\nbuilt of layers of fiberglass laid one atop the other according to a laminate schedule\nprescribed by the builder. In production boatbuilding, laminates are laid down\nfrom outermost to innermost layer in a female mold. The hull and deck are lam-\ninated separately, then glassed, glued, and bolted together after being removed\nfrom their respective molds.\n2\n\n24 The Insider’s Guide to Boat Cleaning and Detailing\nThe first step in the lamination of a hull or deck in its mold, even before the\noutermost layer of fiberglass is laid down, is to spray on a uniform layer of polyester\ngelcoat that is about 15 to 20 mils thick. (One mil equals one one-thousandth of an\ninch.) The gelcoat contains pigments, fillers, and additives designed to serve as a\nbarrier to the elements (similar to the paint on a car body, which helps prevent oxi-\ndation and rust formation). Since the interior surface of the mold is mirror smooth\nand highly polished, the gelcoat surfaces of a new boat should in theory be shiny,\nsmooth, and unblemished.\nMost early fiberglass boats have a solid fiberglass hull and deck. A section\nthrough the hull of such a boat would show an uninterrupted lamination of fiber-\nglass between the outer gelcoat and the inner surface. The thickness of the lamina-\ntion in a 30-foot boat might range from \n1\n⁄ 8 inch at the toe rail to ½ inch or more at\nthe keel. A bigger boat is likely to have thicker sections.\nBeginning in the 1970s, however, boatbuilders found that they could make\nstronger, lighter boats by using composite FRP construction, in which the hull\nand deck are manufactured like a sandwich. Essentially, a composite hull or deck\nincludes three structural layers (not counting the gelcoat, which is cosmetic, not\nstructural): (1) the outer fiberglass laminate; (2) a lightweight core, usually balsa\nor foam; and (3) the inner fiberglass laminate. These three layers are chemically\nbonded together by impregnating the sandwich with resin. A cored deck or hull\ncan be three or four times as thick as its uncored counterpart, yet weigh no more,\nso it is stiffer, stronger, and more resistant to bending and flexing.\nFiberglass boats have long been advertised as being virtually maintenance-\nfree and indestructible, but both claims are exaggerated. True, fiberglass boats\nare certainly much easier to maintain than wooden boats, and fiberglass boats\nbuilt in the 1960s and 1970s are still going strong today. But fiberglass boats are not\nimmune to the ravages of time and the elements.\nFor one thing, gelcoat is not perfectly flat. It contains microscopic cavities\nthat resemble Swiss cheese when viewed at high magnification. The gelcoat, pock-\nmarked with these microscopic cavities, acts like a sponge and collects water-\nsoluble materials such as salt and dust particles.\nIf the boat is not waxed regularly, the gelcoat will become oxidized, which\ncauses the FRP to appear chalky, yellow, or dull. Furthermore, the trapped water-\nsoluble materials become wet and expand, causing pressure within the cavities\n\nWaxing Your Boat 25\nand eventually forming microscopic cracks. This condition is known as gelcoat\nblistering. Untreated blistering can cause pockets of holes to form in the gelcoat,\nallowing water to seep into the underlying laminate and into the core of a compos-\nite boat. If the core is exposed to water, which acts as a solvent, it will chemically\nbreak down. This eventually leads to hull or deck failure.\nOn average a “healthy” FRP boat will absorb 3 percent of its weight in water,\nwhereas an FRP boat with gelcoat blistering might absorb 10 percent or more of its\nweight in water. This reduces cruising performance and substantially increases\nfuel consumption, often by 25 percent or more. And if water wicks into the core\nand a structural hull or deck failure results, the boat’s resale value will be adversely\naffected. The cost of repairing or replacing an FRP deck or hull can run 20 percent\nor more of the original purchase price of the boat. The cost of blister repair can run\nup to 10 percent or more of the boat’s purchase price. Both repairs are very expen-\nsive when compared with the small cost of preventative detailing.\nGranted, there are other avenues besides porous gelcoat for water to penetrate\na hull or deck laminate. Deck hardware fastener holes, the hull-deck joint, and\ncracks, chips, and gouges in the hull or deck are common culprits. But the foregoing\ndiscussion should make clear that keeping your gelcoat sealed is an excellent idea.\nThat’s the technical information that should send you running straight to the\ngarage to dust off your power buffer, racing over to your nearest boat supply store to\nbuy some wax, then gleefully skipping down to your boat to wax it. Of course, that’s\nwhat you set out to do a year ago, and you have yet to finish “that project.” Unfor-\ntunately, that very important task plummeted to the bottom of your Honey-Do list\nas soon as you bought that new “easy to assemble” gas grill last spring (which you\nalso have yet to finish, but I can’t help you with that).\nLet’s get down to business. You can easily wax your boat in one weekend if\nyou’re 17 years old and still have cartilage in your knees and elbows. But if you’re\nsomewhat older than that, you’ll need a good plan of attack to substitute for youth-\nful exuberance, flexibility, and stamina. I break this task down for you so it no\nlonger seems insurmountable and can be done in one week or over a couple of\nweekends. The more oxidized your boat is, the more work it will take, but if you\ntackle your boat in sections, the job won’t seem so overwhelming. If your boat is\nnew or has only light oxidation, it won’t take as long to wax and you’ll have plenty\nof extra time to assemble that gas grill, with no more excuses.\n\n26 The Insider’s Guide to Boat Cleaning and Detailing\nThis chapter covers:\n \nWaxing your boat\n \nPreparation and safety\n \nGear and supplies\n \nWaxing step-by-step\n \nMaintaining an Awlgrip topcoat\nAbout Waxing Your Boat\nHow Often\nIt’s fairly easy to figure out when you need to wax your boat because the gelcoat\nwill tell you by appearing faded rather than shiny. Water fails to bead up or dis-\nsipate as it does after a fresh coat of wax is applied, and water sits longer on wax-\nstarved gelcoat without evaporating. You’ll want to wax your boat before it shows\nyou how thirsty it is for wax, however; otherwise, there will be a period of time\nduring which the sun and other elements will slowly cause the wax-starved gelcoat\nto deteriorate.\nTo repeat, there are two reasons to wax your boat. The first is to protect the\ngelcoat, and since I’m a die-hard practical person, that’s always my first concern.\nBut if you have a newer boat or use enough rubbing compound on an older boat,\nyou’ll be able to get it glossy again, too. This is the added benefit of a good wax job.\nWax your boat to protect it, and the gloss will show itself to you.\nWaxing your boat on a regular basis will help maintain and possibly improve\nits resale value. A clean boat shows prospective buyers that it is well cared for, and\nthis silent message attracts buyers even in a difficult market. Brokers will be happy\nto take your listing, since your boat will show well.\nThere is no standard rule for how often you should wax your boat. A boat that\nis kept in a covered slip and spends little or no time in salt water or direct sunlight\ncould easily get by being waxed every 12 months. At the other extreme, a boat that\nis moored in salt water in a sunny climate (for example, Southern California or\nFlorida) and is not in a covered slip should have its topside waxed every three to\nsix months and its hull waxed every six to nine months. Between these extremes,\na boat moored in an open slip in salt or fresh water but in less intense sunlight\n\nWaxing Your Boat 27\n(for example, the Pacific Northwest) should have its hull and topside waxed every\nspring, and its topside waxed again near the end of the boating season.\nThe accompanying chart will help you see the big picture.\nMoorage Frequency\nNot covered, full sun, and in salt water Wax decks every 3 to 6 months; wax hull every\n6 to 9 months\nNot covered, mostly cloudy, and in salt or\nfresh water\nWax whole boat every spring; wax decks again\nin late summer or fall\nCovered slip in salt or fresh water Wax whole boat every 12 months.\nOf course, even if you keep your boat in a covered slip, if you use it a lot dur-\ning the summer where it is in direct sunlight most of the time or constantly getting\nhit with salt spray, you may want to decrease the time between wax jobs, at least\nfor the topsides. And rinsing your boat with fresh water on a regular basis will help\nprevent salt from etching water spots into the gelcoat.\nDetermine Your Gelcoat’s Condition\nThe accompanying chart describes five gelcoat conditions based on degrees of oxi-\ndation. This will help you determine which wax products, compounds, and equip-\nment to use as we get further into the chapter.\nA glossy hull just after being waxed An oxidized hull\n\n28 The Insider’s Guide to Boat Cleaning and Detailing\nLevel Gelcoat Condition Description\n1 Glossy (no oxidation) “Like-new” gloss, typical of a boat that is less than a\nyear old and is kept in a covered slip or in a non-sunny\nclimate.\n2 Sheen (light oxidation) The gloss is starting to fade in places, usually on the\ntopside first (especially the brow), but there is still a slight\ngloss or sheen on the gelcoat.\n3 Faded (medium oxidation) The gelcoat appears to have a matte finish with no\ngloss left, but when you run your finger over it, there’s\nno chalkiness. The hull may still have a sheen, but the\ntopside is mostly matte.\n4 Chalky (heavy oxidation) There’s no gloss left, and your finger picks up a chalky\nresidue when run over the gelcoat. On a colored\nsurface—say a blue hull—you’ll see a white haze fading\nthe color out.\n5 Chalky and pitted The boat is so oxidized (usually an older boat that’s rarely\nbeen waxed) that even a heavy-duty rubbing compound\ndoesn’t make much of a difference. The gelcoat may be\nthin, and because it hasn’t been protected with wax, it\nmay be riddled with small pinholes or pits. In this case\nthe gelcoat might need to be lightly wet sanded to cut\nthrough the oxidized layer and give you a new base to\nwork with.\nThe topside and the hull can be at different levels of oxidation because the\ntopside is exposed to more direct sunlight and weather. It’s common for the hull to\nbe a level 1 or 2 while the topside is a level 2 or 3.\nTwo additional factors will affect the way you work with your gelcoat and\nwhat results you can expect from it. Those factors are the gelcoat’s thickness and\nits quality (including the quality of its application). Every manufacturer uses a dif-\nferent type and quality of gelcoat, and there is more than one way to apply it (for\nexample, rolled on or sprayed on). As a detailer who has worked on many different\nproduction boats, I have learned which manufacturers use high-quality gelcoat\nbecause it makes our job of waxing boats much easier. We know that no matter\nhow long the owner has let the boat go, high-quality gelcoat will easily come back\nto a glossy state.\nLower-quality or thinly applied gelcoat will be more difficult to bring back to\na glossy state and will require more rubbing compound. You know you’re looking\nat thin gelcoat when you can actually see the fiberglass weave pattern through the\n\nWaxing Your Boat 29\ngelcoat. (This is called “print-through.”) You will rarely be able to achieve a glossy\nfinish on any section exhibiting print-through because there are too many surface\ndeviations for the light to reflect perfectly.\nSome manufacturers use quality gelcoat, yet for whatever reason (maybe\nhaving to do with how the gelcoat was applied), wax swirls easily, and it is almost\nimpossible to keep swirls out of the finish even if you use a soft wax with no com-\npound in it, applying and removing it\nby hand. You will be able to see those\nswirls only when the boat is sitting in\ndirect sunlight. By the way, this is the\nonly benefit of waxing a boat in direct\nsunlight—to make sure you’re not mak-\ning any swirls as you go. If you find that\nyou are, you can make a mid-course\ncorrection in the wax products you’re\nusing or in your technique of applying\nand removing the wax.\nOne-Step or Multistep Procedures\n(or What’s It Going to Take?)\nOnce you have a better understanding of your gelcoat’s present condition, you’ll\nhave a better idea of just what it’s going to take to bring it back to glossy. I consider\n“glossy” the ultimate, aspirational goal, because if the boat looks glossy, it means\nthere is no oxidation on the gelcoat. There are typically three approaches you can\ntake to bring a boat back to glossy, and which of the three you use will depend on\nthe gelcoat’s condition and on how long you hope the wax job to last.\n \nThe one-step approach uses either a soft wax (with no rubbing compound\nin it) or a cleaner wax (a mixture of compound and wax) to protect the\ngelcoat and bring it back to glossy. On brand-new boats or on boats with\nlight to medium oxidation (level 1, 2, or 3 in the accompanying table), this\nis all you need to do.\n \nIn a two-step approach, you do a first pass with just rubbing compound to\ncut through the top layer of gelcoat and remove oxidation, then a second\npass with just wax to protect the gelcoat from oxidizing further. This is the\nIt’s easier to check for swirl marks in direct sunlight.\n\n30 The Insider’s Guide to Boat Cleaning and Detailing\napproach you might choose for a boat with medium to heavy oxidation\n(level 3 or 4).\n \nIf your boat falls into the category of level 3 or 4, and if you want to achieve\nthat showroom gloss again or you want or need the wax job to last an extra-\nlong time, you may choose to follow a three-step process. You would first go\nover the boat with compound to remove oxidation, then you would repeat\nwith polish to seal the gelcoat, and finally you would apply and buff a coat\nof wax to further protect it. If you’re hiring a detailer to wax your boat,\nexpect to pay almost two or three times as much for a two- or three-step\nprocess because the detailer will go over every inch of waxable gelcoat two\nor three times.\nA coat of wax starts to thin within three to six months after application. Some\nwaxes claim to last 12 months or longer, to which I say sure, if you keep your boat\nin a boathouse and take it out only after the sun has gone down.\nPreparation\nIt is best to start with a clean surface—one that is free of dirt and mildew. The pres-\nent condition of the gelcoat—glossy or faded, chalky or pitted, swirled or swirl-free,\nwith or without print-through—should be clearly visible so you know exactly what\nyou’re working with.\nIf your boat already has swirls in the gelcoat that refuse to go away while you’re\nwaxing, you’ll at least know that you weren’t the one who put them there. If you notice\nthat the deck surfaces are considerably more faded than the hull, you may decide to\ndo a two-step job on the deck structures\n(or maybe just the brow) and only a one-\nstep job on the hull. If you can see the\nunderlying fiberglass pattern through\nthe gelcoat, you’ll know that no matter\nhow good your wax job is, it may not look\nperfectly glossy in that area because of\nthe surface deviations. And so on.\nStart by washing your boat and\nremoving all dirt and mildew. Don’t\nNote: A professional boat detailer may not fully\nwash your boat before waxing it if the boat is only a\nbit dusty and the detailer’s crew knows that they’ll\nbe using a cleaner wax (wax mixed with compound)\nand a power buffer. A little dust is of little concern\ngiven that the rubbing compound will grind into your\ngelcoat to remove the top layer of oxidation. The crew\nshould, however, fully wash the boat after waxing it\nto remove wax dust from all surfaces.\n\nWaxing Your Boat 31\nbother trying to remove water stains, scuff marks, or bird-dropping residues that\nwon’t come off with soap and water because the wax will remove them. Once\nyou wash your boat, you’re almost ready to start, but first let’s go over a few quick\npointers.\nWeather and Waxing\nWhat the weather is doing can greatly affect your wax job and even determine how\nyou will apply the wax and how long you’ll let it sit on the gelcoat before you buff\nit in and off. The only weather you cannot wax in is rain; wax isn’t too difficult to\napply in rain, but it’s next to impossible to remove. You should work in rainy condi-\ntions only if you’re working under a tarp or if you’re working on a hull that is at such\nan angle that the rain isn’t hitting it directly. If you’re using a rubbing compound\nwith a buffer, you can work in mist or light rain because in most cases you will buff\nthe rubbing compound off before it dries completely. Other external conditions\nyou should consider include:\n \nDirect sunlight. You’ll easily be able to see if you’re creating swirl marks,\nbut the sun will cause the wax to dry faster, and if you have oxidized gelcoat\n(level 2 or higher) or thin, older gelcoat, the wax won’t come off easily (or\nat all) if left to sit too long in the sun. It’s best to do the job in 3-foot-square\nareas, applying and buffing a section at a time.\n \nHot day. Even if you’re waxing in the shade, you may need to work in\nsmaller sections so the wax doesn’t dry out before you can buff it. This isn’t\na problem with newer, still-glossy gelcoat (level 1). In fact, you could apply\nwax to the entire boat and then buff it off and it would still be easy to work\nwith. If your boat’s gelcoat condition is level 2 or greater, however, smaller\nsections are the rule in hot weather.\n \nTemperate shade. These are the best conditions for waxing. Although you\nwon’t easily be able to see swirl marks, you can work in larger sections\nbecause the wax won’t dry fast without direct sun or excessive heat. Just\nremember, the porosity of the gelcoat (a function of oxidation and thickness)\nis even more important than sun and heat in causing wax to become hard to\nremove. If your gelcoat condition is level 2 or higher, always work in smaller\nsections so you don’t have to worry about the wax drying into the gelcoat.\n\n32 The Insider’s Guide to Boat Cleaning and Detailing\n \nRain or moisture. It is impossible to get good results in rain, fog, or heavy\nhumidity. You may be able to apply the wax fairly easily, but the wax has to\nbe dry in order to be wiped or buffed off without creating splotchy results.\n \nCold weather. In temperatures below, say, 40 degrees Fahrenheit, the wax\neither won’t dry at all or will take too long to dry to a haze, leaving you\nstanding around in the cold, waiting.\nIt’s better to wax a boat in temperatures\nof 45 degrees or higher (if you must do\nit at all in colder weather) and prefer-\nably when the sun is on the boat to help\nwarm the gelcoat.\nWaxing at a Boatyard\nIf your boat will be pulled out to have work done at a service yard, you may want\nto think twice about having it waxed in the yard. Although it can be easier to wax\nwhen the boat is out of the water, at any given time when conditions are appropri-\nate for waxing, there is likely to be a boat getting painted somewhere in the yard,\nand any airborne overspray can land on your boat, causing it to turn gray in those\nareas as if afflicted with small gray water spots. This condition is known as the\n“boatyard blues.” You can’t feel the overspray on the gelcoat, but you can see it.\nHaving it land on your boat is one thing, but having it get mixed in with the wax\nand then get buffed into your boat is another matter entirely. In the latter instance\nit will remain on your boat much longer, because the UV protectants in the wax\nwill prevent the sun from being able to bleach out the overspray flecks. You will\nbasically have waxed it into the gelcoat.\nIf your boat does have paint overspray on it, the best way to remove it is to\napply rubbing compound or acetone to that area, which will remove the wax and\ntop layer of overspray. (Use acetone over a smaller area, or use rubbing compound\nif the overspray covers a large area. Acetone is not recommended for large sections\nof gelcoat; nor is it human-friendly. Wear gloves and a respirator when working\nwith acetone.) You will still be able to see gray spots, but they will be lighter than\nwhen you started. Now let the boat sit for a couple of days while the sun bleaches\nout the remaining stains. If your boat is in direct sunlight, this may only take 24\nhours. After a few days at most, the overspray stains should be gone and you can\nTip: If your boat is normally in direct sunlight on one\nside but shady on the other, work on the shady side,\nthen turn the boat to work on the other side.\n\nWaxing Your Boat 33\nthen re-wax that area to protect it again. If you don’t want to trust the sun, or you\nneed to remove the overspray stains immediately, simply rub much harder and for\na longer period of time with rubbing compound until the stains are gone. You’ll\nneed to re-wax that area to protect it again when you’re finished.\nSafety and Hard-to-Reach Areas\nThere is no argument here—waxing a boat is hard work. It requires physical\nstrength, agility, coordination, and balance as well as repetitive motions with your\narm or wrist. Nevertheless, most anyone can do it as long as you take the necessary\nprecautions and take your time, allowing short breaks to give yourself and your\nbody a rest. When I started my boat detailing company at the age of 19, I could eas-\nily wash seven boats a day or wax a ski boat in four hours and do something active\nwith my friends in the afternoon. Now, in my late thirties, I’m lucky to get three\nboats washed in a day without suffering an achy lower back and sore wrists and\ntaking Advil with dinner. But don’t let that scare you. The achy lower back is most\nlikely from trying to carry all my gear to each boat rather than using a dock cart,\nIt’s hard to avoid getting overspray, known as the “boatyard blues,” on your boat at the service yard.\n\n34 The Insider’s Guide to Boat Cleaning and Detailing\nand the sore wrists are from an unforgettable run-in with a tractor while riding a\ncertain horse whose name I won’t mention at the moment. But I digress. Take your\ntime and divide the boat into sections so it’s not so overwhelming.\nOn a flybridge powerboat, the brow over the windshield is probably the most\ndifficult area to reach, especially if it’s more vertical than horizontal. You’ll be able\nto reach the lower half of the brow by standing (carefully) on the lower edge of the\nwindshield, but be careful not to put any weight on the windshield glass or too\nmuch weight on the frames lest it weaken the seal and cause water to seep in the\nnext time it rains or you wash your boat. You may be able to reach the top edge of\nthe brow by leaning over the windscreen from the flybridge, but how do you reach\nthe entire middle section? A ladder doesn’t work well because it’s difficult to stabi-\nlize, and even if you can make it stable enough to climb on, it won’t provide a good\nplatform from which to reach that section, especially if you’re holding a buffer.\nThe best solution is to rappel down from the flybridge or attach a suction cup\nhandle to the brow to use as a foothold. If you choose to rappel down, you will need\na rope that is strong enough to secure you; one end of it will be tied around your\nwaist, and the other end will be securely tied around a metal post (preferably the\npost of the captain’s chair) in the flybridge. Once you’ve tied both ends and posi-\ntioned your gear (wax, buffer, and rags)\nnearby, climb out of the flybridge and\nover the windscreen, and slowly lower\nyourself, making sure you feel secure\nbefore you actually start working on\nthis area. If the rope will be draped\nover the windscreen, be careful not to\nput your full weight on the rope if you\ncan help it to avoid cracking or scrap-\ning the windscreen. You can then begin\nwaxing and buffing this area safely.\nThe best way to reach the side of\nthe hull away from the dock is to turn\nyour boat. My crew and I have tried\nwaxing boats from f loating rafts and\ntenders, but it is more work than it’s\nworth. For one thing, if you’re using\nUse suction-cup handles when waxing the brow to give\nyou something to hold onto.\n\nWaxing Your Boat 35\nan electric buffer, there are now more\nopportunities for the cord to go into the\nwater, causing an electric shock. Also,\nbecause you’ll need one hand to help\nkeep yourself in one place while work-\ning, you are left with only one hand\nto work the buffer, which won’t allow\nyou to get good leverage on your work\nand will result in a splotchy job. Even\nif you’re waxing by hand, you may not\nbe able to apply enough even pressure\nto the rag to get a smooth, even result.\nAnd if your slip has a high dock from\nwhich you can’t easily reach the lower\nportions of the hull, you’ll want to move\nyour boat to a low dock while you com-\nplete the job.\nThe most important safety issue when waxing your boat is not letting the\nelectric cord of a power buffer come in contact with water. And it can happen eas-\nily if you’re not careful. The best way to prevent this accident is by wrapping the\nextension cord around each cleat between the power source (either the power\npole at the dock or an outlet on your boat) and where you’re working. Also tie the\nextension cord and the buffer’s cord in a loose knot before plugging them into\neach other. This way, when you tug on\nthe cord as you move farther down the\nboat, the cords won’t come unplugged\nfrom each other and fall into the water.\nW hen you’re work ing direct ly over\nwater, wrap the cord nearest the buffer\naround your hand or forearm\nAnother safety concern is keeping\nthe buffer’s cord from wrapping around\nyour neck while you’re running the buf-\nfer. I know this sounds crazy, but it can\nhappen if you’re not paying attention. \nThis safety technique keeps the cords from coming apart\nwhile you’re running the buffer.\nIt’s much easier to reach the hull on a dock that is level\nwith the water line.\n\n36 The Insider’s Guide to Boat Cleaning and Detailing\nGiven just the slightest contact, the spinning head will “grab” the cord and start\nwrapping it around the neck of the buffer. If part of that cord is hanging over the back\nof your neck or shoulders (where you draped it to keep it out of your way), you can\nbe sure your neck will become involved in the action. It will happen so fast that your\nface may be less than an inch from the spinning buffer pad before you realize that\nall you have to do to stop this impending doom is take your finger off the trigger.\nTo my knowledge, at the time of this writing, there has never been a reported\ninjury or accident from someone picking up a phone and dialing the number of a\nboat detailer. If nothing else, you’ll always have this to fall back on if for some rea-\nson you decide not to do the work yourself.\nGear and Supplies\nThe more oxidized your gelcoat is, the more gear you will need. A glossy boat\nrequires less gear. It’s that simple. Here’s a list of all the gear and supplies you’ll\nneed to wax a boat in any condition; from this master list, based on the condition\nof your gelcoat, you can create your own list.\nKeep in mind that waxes improve every year, and the products I list today\nmay be outdated in a few years, or there will be new and better products on the\nmarket to replace them. In addition to naming a few brands, I include a description\nof what type of wax to look for in case the brands I name aren’t sold in your area.\nWaxing, Rubbing Compound, and Polish\nHere’s a scenario we’re all familiar with. You’ve finally decided to wax your boat,\nso you head over to your nearest boating supply store to buy some wax. An hour\nlater, after standing in front of all those products on the shelf that cry out “easy to\nuse,” “no rubbing—just wipe on and off,” “practically waxes your boat for you,”\nand “leaves a glossy finish for at least seven years,” you are thoroughly confused,\nfrustrated, and ready to throw in the towel. Don’t give up just yet. There are many\ntypes of waxes out there, and some work better than others on certain types and\nconditions of gelcoat. With the following tips and advice, you’ll be able to walk into\nthe store, grab the wax you need like a pro, and go!\nMany factors affect what products you should use and how you should apply\nand buff off the wax. Every boat manufacturer uses a slightly different gelcoat.\nYour boat may be faded on deck but still glossy on the hull. You may have color\n\nWaxing Your Boat 37\nstripes or a colored hull that is more faded than the rest of the boat. Your boat may\nhave slight scratches or swirl marks that are difficult to remove. Therefore, you\ncan’t always buy just one bottle of wax that will give you great results on all areas\nof your boat, even if your boat is brand new. You may need to buy two or three dif-\nferent types of wax or rubbing compound for differently oxidized sections, or you\nmay find that mixing different waxes and rubbing compounds creates the perfect\nproduct for your gelcoat. The following list describes the different types of waxes,\ncompounds, and polishes you’ll find at your local boating store.\n \nCarnauba or pure wax. I also refer to this as soft wax, meaning that it con-\ntains no rubbing compound. It comes in liquid form in a squeeze bottle\nor in paste form in a metal tin.\nSince it contains no compound,\nit is best for a brand-new boat\nthat has no oxidation (level 1)\nor for the finishing step in a\ntwo- or three-step process. It\ncan easily be applied by hand\nor with a buffer.\n \nCleaner wax. This is a combination of wax and rubbing compound. It’s\nthe equivalent of doing a two-step wax job in one easy step. It is ideal to\nuse on boats that have light to medium oxidation (described as level 2 or\n3 in the oxidation table earlier in this chapter). There are many brands of\ncleaner wax on the market. Thicker, more clay-like compositions are good\nfor medium (level 3) oxidation, whereas thinner waxes are better for lighter\n(level 2) oxidation. Shake the bottle, and if the contents easily move around,\nit’s a good cleaner wax for light oxidation. If the contents don’t shake much,\nyou’ve found a good cleaner wax for medium oxidation.\nW hile you’re standing in front of the wax section, grab a jug of\nMeguiar’s Cleaner Wax and shake it. Then grab a jug of 3M Cleaner Wax\nand shake that. You’ll instantly be able to tell the difference and will have\ngained a better understanding of a cleaner wax meant for light oxidation\n(Meguiar’s) and one meant for medium oxidation (3M). Although it’s best\nto use a power buffer with any cleaner wax, a thinner formulation can be\napplied and buffed off by hand with fair results. This is not possible with a\nthicker formulation.\nNote: When using a soft or pure wax (one with no\nbuffing compound), you can use either a liquid wax\nfrom a squeeze bottle or a paste wax from a can. The\nresults will be the same. If you’re using a cleaner wax,\nhowever, liquid wax from a squeeze bottle is easier to\napply properly and gives you a more even distribution\nof rubbing compound than paste wax from a can.\n\n38 The Insider’s Guide to Boat Cleaning and Detailing\n \nRestorer wax. This type of wax is very thick, more rubbing compound than\nwax, and is meant for boats with heavy oxidation (level 4). If you don’t have\nmuch experience working with compounds and power buffers, this type of\nwax is not your best choice. It’s like working with pure clay. A better option\nis to mix other types of rubbing compounds and waxes until you find a\nmixture that gives you the desired result. I discuss this technique later in\nthe chapter.\n \nRubbing compounds. There are many types of compounds. To make your\noptions less confusing, I take the extremely simplified route of categorizing\nthem by color—either brown or white. (You may not be able to tell if a com-\npound is brown or white unless you open the lid.) The brown compounds\nare thicker and are used primarily to remove heavier oxidation. Their main\ningredient is clay (Tripoli). An example of this type is 3M Super Duty Rub-\nbing Compound. The white compounds are thinner and are most often\nused to remove scratches, swirl marks, and light to medium oxidation, or\nas a finishing polish. Their main ingredient is aluminum oxide. Examples\ninclude 3M Imperial Compound and Finishing Material and 3M Finesse It\nFinishing Material. Remember that pure rubbing compound contains no\nwax, whereas cleaner wax is a mixture of rubbing compound and wax.\n \nPolishes. A polish doesn’t have wax in it but contains other synthetic ingre-\ndients that do the job of wax. An example is Starbrite Premium Marine\nPolish with PTEF. PTEF is Starbrite’s registered trademark name for poly-\ntetraflouroethylene, the generic version of Teflon. We’re familiar with Tef-\nlon because it’s on pots and pans and\ncreates an easy-to-work-with, nonstick\nsurface. Likewise, by polishing your\nboat with a similar ingredient, you’re\ncreating a smooth surface on the gelcoat\nthat helps prevent salt spray, bird drop-\npings, and other particles from sticking\ninto it. It is UV resistant and can last\na long time. Polishes are used on new\ngelcoat or gelcoat that has already had\nthe oxidation cut through or buffed out.\nNote: I refer to the 3M and Meguiar’s brands simply\nbecause I use them most often and am most familiar\nwith them. There are many other excellent brands,\nincluding Collinite, SeaPower, Interlux, and Starbrite,\nto name just a few. Additionally, there are specialized\nbrands from smaller companies that you can order\nonly online. The main thing to look for is a wax that is\nmeant for gelcoat, provides UV protection, and either\ndoes or does not contain compound, depending\non the level of oxidation in the surface you will be\ntreating.\n\nWaxing Your Boat 39\nApplying polish by hand or with a buffer will give equally good results.\nApplying polish is the second step in a three-step wax process.\n \nCopolymer sealants. Examples of these products include the Vertglas and\nPoliglow systems. With these systems, you are not waxing your boat but\nrather sealing the gelcoat, which helps protect it from becoming more oxi-\ndized. It’s like putting a hard candy shell on your gelcoat. I do not use these\nproducts on boats and do not have any experience with them, so I don’t go\ninto detail about how they work. I have heard mixed reviews about prod-\nucts like these, which require you to apply five or more coats in order to get\nthe most gloss and protection for your gelcoat. Additionally, you can’t apply\nwax over these sealants in the future if you desire but must first remove\nthe sealant completely from the gelcoat, which requires a lot of rubbing\ncompound.\nPower Buffers\nIf you plan to wax your boat yourself, you should buy a power buffer. If you plan\nto hire a professional, however, and simply want to keep up selected areas on your\nown between the detailer’s wax jobs, you don’t need to spend $200 or so on a good\npolisher/buffer. The detailer will cut through the oxidation, so you can simply\napply a soft wax or cleaner wax by hand to maintain the polish on the areas you’re\ntargeting.\nThe best power buffer I’ve used is the German-made Porter-Cable 9428. We\nwax boats five days a week year-round, running a buffer several hours a day, stop-\nping it and starting it, getting wax dust in it and occasionally dropping it in the\nwater, which is never good for the buffer or the unlucky person still holding the\nelectric cord. Our Porter-Cables ran four years straight before finally dying on us. I\ntook them in for servicing, and now they’re up and running again. Unfortunately,\nPorter-Cable discontinued this model, so now you can buy it only on eBay or Craigs\nlist. If you’re looking for power buffers online, search for the words “variable-speed\npolisher,” which is how these types of buffers are usually categorized.\nOne runner-up is the Makita 9227. This power buffer has features similar to\nthose of the Porter-Cable 9428 and looks almost exactly the same. I purchased a\nfew of these to replace our old Porter-Cables, and so far we’ve been fairly happy\n\n40 The Insider’s Guide to Boat Cleaning and Detailing\nwith them. This model is lighter than the Porter-Cable and has less vibration, but\nit heats up quickly. That won’t affect the results, though.\nAnother runner-up is the DeWalt 849, but this buffer’s slow-start feature is\nvery sensitive and doesn’t take much pressure on the trigger to go from slow to fast.\nInstead you have to be ready to start at a high speed. The body is slightly longer\nand heavier than the others. It also comes with a straight rather than D-shaped\nhandle, which makes it somewhat more difficult to hold and maneuver, and it\nruns at a faster speed and with more torque than the others, so you have to know\nwhat you’re doing before you touch it to gelcoat. All in all, it’s a good buffer for an\nexperienced operator who is strong enough to control it and is using compound\non a heavily oxidized boat. The more oxidation you need to cut through, the more\npower you need from a buffer.\nYou might be able to save a few dollars if you buy a used or refurbished buffer\nfrom a reliable seller. If you’ll be using it only once or twice a year, a used model in\ngood working condition should be fine.\nThe buffers I’ve described are all variable-speed polishers/buffers and can\nonly be purchased at large hardware stores or online. The types of buffers sold at\nyour local boating supply store are not very effective on anything but a brand new\nboat that requires only a light coat of pure liquid wax with no rubbing compound\nin it. They are random orbital buffers and are difficult to hold properly for long\nperiods of time. They also don’t allow you to apply even pressure while you work,\nand you will often end up with splotchy results.\nFor those of you who own smaller boats (less then 25 feet in length) or ski\nboats, you might consider a few of the polishers/buffers that are sold for auto\ndetailing. They have a smaller pad base (usually receiving a 5- or 6-inch buffing\npad rather than a 9-inch pad), can get into tight areas, and are lighter and easier to\nhold. Some of these buffers include the Porter and Cable 7424 Detailing Machine,\nthe Meguiars G-110 Dual Action Polisher and the Flex XC3401VRG Dual-Action\nPolisher. You can search for these online as well as for the various pads and acces-\nsories for them. One good website to start with is www.ProperAutoCare.com.\nIf you’re going to use a power buffer, you’ll also need an extension cord, a spur\n(a tool used to clean wax off the buffer wheel), and a power adapter (if you want\nto plug it into the dock rather than your boat). You will also need buffing pads for\napplying and buffing off wax and rubbing compound. There are wool, foam, and\n\nWaxing Your Boat 41\nsynthetic pads to choose from; however, I rarely get good results from the synthetic\npads, so I will mostly focus on the wool and foam pads. Wool pads are best for\nlevel 2 or greater gelcoat, and foam pads are best for brand new or level 1 gelcoat.\nYou can use a single-sided pad that attaches to the disc head with a Velcro back-\ning plate or a double-sided pad that attaches to the disc head with a small adapter\npiece. A double-sided head can get into tighter spots because you can use the edges\nmore effectively, and it’s just as quick and easy to flip over for the cleaner side as it\nis to rip off a Velcro-backed pad and slap on a new one.\n \nWool compounding pads are typically white (like the 3M Perfect-It III\nCompounding Pad or the 3M Superbuff III Buffing Pad) and are used for\napplying or buffing out rubbing compound on an oxidized boat (level 2 or\ngreater).\n \nWool finishing pads are usually yellow (like the 3M Superbuff Polishing\nPad) and are used for applying or buffing off liquid wax on a new boat or\ncleaner wax on a level 1 or 2 boat after you’ve used the compounding pad\nwith rubbing compound to remove oxidation.\n \nHeavy-cut foam pads are best for removing deeper scratches or heavy\noxidation.\n \nMedium-cut foam pads have 90 percent of the cutting power of the heavy-\ncut pad but finishes like a polishing pad with minimum haze. Always try\nthis pad first before using the heavy-cut pad to remove deeper swirls and\nscratches.\n \nMild-cut foam pads are used\nfor polishing to restore gloss\nand remove light oxidation and\nfine swirls.\n \nNo-cut foam pads are superfine\nfinishing pads for applying the\nfinal liquid wax or polish. This\nis also the pad to use for layer-\ning one wax on top of another\nto build up coats for added pro-\ntection and shine. Use a spur to clean your buffing pads so they last longer.\n\n42 The Insider’s Guide to Boat Cleaning and Detailing\nOther Gear\nThe only other gear you’ll need is:\n \nRags. If you’ll be waxing and buffing by hand, use terry cloth rags or old\nT-shirts to apply the wax and microfiber rags to remove it. If you’re using\na power buffer to buff off the wax, you’ll still need a few microfiber rags to\nremove any remaining light haze or wax dust that the buffer doesn’t get.\n \nSqueeze bottles. The thicker the wax, the harder it is to squeeze from the\nbottle it comes in. Transfer the wax to a few spare squeeze bottles (with the\nhelp of a small funnel), and use those while you’re working on your boat.\n \nDust mask. When you remove wax by hand or with a buffer, a fine mist of\nwax dust will cover everything, including you. Because the particles are so\nfine, you’ll breathe them in if you don’t wear a dust mask. I suggest wear-\ning one if you have respiratory problems or if you’re sensitive to dust and\nparticles in the air.\nWaxing Step-by-Step\nIn most maintenance work, 90 percent is preparation and 10 percent is the actual\ntask. For waxing a boat, however, I would change that ratio to 30/70. Preparation is\nimportant, but technique is king. In this section I help you learn how to wax your\nboat based on its level of oxidation—the main deciding factor in what products\nand techniques you’ll use.\nFor a Level 1 Boat (No Oxidation)\nA boat attains level 1 status because it is less than a year old or because you removed\nall oxidation with the last wax job and have since kept the boat in a covered slip\nand operated it only in the shade. In other words, a pure level 1 boat is rare. On the\nother hand, it is not unusual for a boat to show light oxidation on areas like a brow\nor foredeck but retain a good gloss elsewhere. In such a case, treat the oxidized\nareas as level 2 and everything else as level 1.\nLevel 1 areas need only a soft wax, with no rubbing compound in it, or a pol-\nish. You don’t want to use compound where there is no oxidation to cut through,\nor you’ll create swirl marks or even very light scratches. You can apply the wax and\nbuff it off either by hand or with a power buffer. If applying by hand, make sure you\n\nWaxing Your Boat 43\nhold the rag or pad as flat as you can.\nPlace your hand flat over the rag (which\nyou’ve folded in half once and then\nin half again) to apply pressure when\nspreading the wax. Do not hold the rag\nas you would a sponge and apply pres-\nsure with your fingertips. If you apply\npressure mostly with your fingertips\n(unless in a small area—for example,\naround a stanchion, where only your\nfingertips can fit), the wa x won’t be\napplied evenly and smoothly, and when\nyou wipe or buff it off, the results will\nlook splotchy. Keep your hand flat over\nthe folded rag and apply pressure as\nevenly as you can in a circular motion.\nGo over the section you’re doing a few\ntimes to make sure you cover it evenly\nand entirely.\nYou can apply the wax by hand\nand buff it off with a power buffer, or\nyou can apply and buff the wax with a\nbuffer. The same observations apply.\nKeep the buffer pad as flat as you can\ninstead of tipping it or using the edges,\nand try to maintain an even pressure as\nyou proceed. Uneven pressure causes\nthe edges to bear on the gelcoat, and the\nresult is swirl marks or splotchiness.\nSof t w a xes a nd pol i shes t hat\ndon’t contain rubbing compound can\nbe allowed to dry to a haze before you\nwipe or buff them off.

If it’s a sunny day, polarized sunglasses\nwill help you see imperfections. If you see swirl marks,\nuneven light reflections, splotchiness, or dull spots,\nyou should go over the area again using flat, even\npressure. Try working small sections at a time. If one\nside of your boat is in the shade, do that side first.\nLook down the side of the boat at an angle to check for\nsplotchiness and make sure nothing was missed.\n\n44 The Insider’s Guide to Boat Cleaning and Detailing\nit off. In direct sunlight, however, it’s better to do smaller sections at a time so the\nwax doesn’t dry into the gelcoat and become difficult to remove.\nFor a Level 2 Boat (Light Oxidation)\nIf your boat is lightly oxidized, use a thin cleaner wax such as Meguiar’s Cleaner\nWax or SeaPower. You can work by hand or with a buffer, but either way be sure\nto use even pressure when you apply the wax. In fact, light oxidation over still-\nexisting gloss is a condition that invites more swirl marks than any other. You want\nto cut through the light layer of oxidation but not scratch or swirl the still-glossy\nfinish. A good product for this gelcoat condition is Meguiar’s Flagship Premium\nMarine Wax. Alternatively, you can try\nmixing one part 3M Finesse It with two\nor three parts soft liquid wax.\nOnce you’ve applied the wax, let\nit dry to a haze and then wipe or buff\nit off. If you’re using a buffer, keep the\nbuffing pad as flat as you can against\nthe surface of the boat to prevent swirl\nmarks. When finished, go over the area\nonce more w ith a microfiber rag to\nremove all wax dust and haze.\nWhen applying wax, use a slower\nbuffer speed for a more even applica-\ntion. If you’re using a squeeze bottle,\napply a thin line of wax directly onto the\ngelcoat surface and then use the buffer\nat a slow speed to spread or apply the\nwax in that section. Double the speed\nwhen it’s time to buff the wax off and\nthen follow up with a microfiber rag\nto remove all wax dust. For example, if\nyour buffer offers speed levels from one\nto six, use level two or three to spread\nthe wax on and level four or five to buff\nit in and off.\nKeep the buffer flat against the gelcoat to prevent burning\nand swirl marks.\nTip: Most bottles of wax state in their instructions\nthat you should let the wax dry to a haze before\nyou wipe or buff it off, and this is indeed the way to\nproceed with thin cleaner wax on a lightly oxidized\nboat. If you’re using thick cleaner wax or rubbing\ncompound on a moderately (level 3) to heavily (level\n4) oxidized gelcoat surface, however, it’s better to\nbuff the wax or compound off while it is still a little\nwet. The remaining moisture, together with the\npower of the buffer, will help the wax or compound\ncut through the oxidation.\n\nWaxing Your Boat 45\nFor a Level 3 Boat (Medium Oxidation)\nWhen your boat shows medium oxidation in most areas, a power buffer is almost\na necessity. You can try to apply and remove the cleaner wax by hand, but it will be\nmore difficult to work (read “sore wrists”) and it won’t cut through the oxidation as\nwell or as evenly as you’ll need to get a glossy result. It will almost definitely look\nsplotchy when you’re finished. If you don’t own a power buffer and don’t want to\nspend $200 to buy one, consider renting one from a tool rental company. If their\nrental fee is around $40 per day, however, and you think it might take you three or\nmore days to wax your boat, you might as well buy a buffer. If you’ll be using it only\na few times a year, it will last forever. (And you can use it on your automobiles with\na foam pad at slower speeds.)\nTo effectively remove medium oxidation, you’ll want to use a thick cleaner\nwax such as 3M Cleaner Wax. Apply the wax by hand or with a buffer, using the\nbuffer with a compounding pad to work it into the gelcoat while the wax is still\nslightly wet and then buffing it off with\na finishing pad. Follow up with a micro-\nfiber rag to remove the wax dust. Work\nin small sections, and work mostly on\nthe shaded side of the boat or at least\nnot in direct sunlight and not on a day\nthat is warmer than 90 degrees.\nIf one type of wax that is meant\nfor medium oxidation doesn’t work as\nwell as you were hoping, you can get\ncreative and try mixing different waxes\nand compounds together. It is also at\nthis stage that your boat may need a\ntwo-step approach—a first pass with rubbing compound and a second pass with\nwax—in order to remove the oxidation and bring back a glossy finish. My crew\noften comes across medium to heavily oxidized boats that don’t respond at all to\njust one type of wax or compound straight from the bottle. We end up trying vari-\nous mixes of wax and compounds until we find one that works on that particular\nquality and thickness of gelcoat and its level of oxidation. We have yet to find the\none perfect mixture that works on all types of gelcoat with all levels of oxidation,\nand leaves a perfect finish every time. It would cost a lot of money to buy several\ndifferent types of waxes and compounds, so your best bet for level 3 gelcoat is to\nThis heavily oxidized sailboat definitely needs a two-step\napproach.\n\n46 The Insider’s Guide to Boat Cleaning and Detailing\nbuy one bottle of a thick cleaner wax (such as 3M Cleaner Wax), one bottle of thin\nrubbing compound (such as 3M Imperial Compound), and one bottle of soft wax\n(with no compound in it). We often mix two or more of these products until we find\na combination that works well.\nFor a Level 4 Boat (Heavy Oxidation)\nHeavy oxidation requires a two-step process. You must first remove the oxida-\ntion before you can apply wax or polish to the boat. A cleaner wax won’t be strong\nenough to remove the oxidation; you’ll\nneed to use compou nd f irst. Once\nagain, a mixture of a few different rub-\nbing compounds might work best. Start\nwith a compound such as 3M Imperial\nCompound or 3M Super Duty Rubbing\nCompound. If you’re using the latter or\nits equivalent, you’ll want to apply it\nwith a buffer at a slower speed and then\nuse a faster speed to buff it in and off\nwhile it’s still wet. Your buffing pad will\nbecome gummy quickly because this is like working with pure liquid clay. Have a\nspur and extra buffing pads handy.\nOnce you have finished the first step of removing the layer of oxidation from\nthe gelcoat, you’re ready to apply polish (if you’re doing a three-step process) or\nwax (if you’re doing a two-step process).\nIn either case, you can apply the prod-\nuct by hand and use the buffer to buff\nit off. This will ensure a more even fin-\nish. You should use a pure liquid wax\nfor the two-step approach even if you\nremoved the oxidation in the first step,\nbut you can use a thinner product such\nas Meguiar’s or SeaPower rather than\na thicker one, like 3M. If your first pass\nwith compound left a perfectly glossy\nA waxed and buffed topside. Compare this polished\nsurface with the dull gelcoat in the photo on page 45.\nNote: If you’re afraid of ruining your gelcoat when\ntrying different mixes of wax and compound,\nremember that it’s not the mixing of products that\ntypically ruins gelcoat, but rather the incorrect use\nof a buffer. You can “burn” gelcoat if you (1) use the\nbuffer at too fast a speed when you’re buffing off wax\nor compound that has dried to a haze, or (2) press too\nhard on the buffer when using a thin cleaner wax or\nlight compound.\n\nWaxing Your Boat 47\nsurface, you can effectively apply a soft wax or polish (with no compound in it) by\nhand or with a buffer.\nFor a Level 5 Boat (Chalky and Pitted)\nIf your gelcoat is at this degree of oxidation, chances are you have an older boat or\none that sits in the sun and has not been waxed in a long time. An older boat in this\ncondition most likely has thin, worn gelcoat as well. This combination—extreme\noxidation and thin gelcoat—is a bad one. In this case your goal is not to bring back\na glossy finish but rather, first and foremost, to remove as much oxidation as you\ncan without compounding completely through the remaining gelcoat. Then you’ll\nwant to apply a good coat of wax to protect the remaining gelcoat and prevent fur-\nther oxidation. If this compromise yields a glossy finish, pat yourself and that good\nole boat on the back!\nFollow the same steps as you would for a level 4 boat. If your boat is older and\nthe gelcoat is fairly thin, however, be careful not to press too hard on the buffer\nwhen you’re buffing the wax off. Definitely do not work in direct sunlight or on a\nvery hot day, or the wax will soak in almost instantly and be difficult to remove. Do\nsmall sections at a time for this same reason.\nWaxing Colored Stripes\nIf your boat has colored stripes on topside or at the waterline, there is a risk that\nthe color will run when waxed, especially if you’re using compound or the stripe\nis older. The best way to prevent this is to apply painter’s tape on either side of\nthe stripe. Once you’ve taped off the stripe, wax it (by hand or with a buffer), then\nremove all wax dust and haze with a microfiber rag. When finished, slowly lift the\ntape to remove it. If you are then ready to wax the area around the stripe, apply\npainter’s tape over the freshly waxed stripe and it won’t run when you wax that\nsection with the buffer.\nA Final Word on Waxing\nAfter reading these detailed instructions, tips, notes, and suggestions, you might\nstill feel like you just don’t get it. You might still be asking yourself, “But how exactly\n\n48 The Insider’s Guide to Boat Cleaning and Detailing\ndo I use the buffer? Where do I even begin?” It can seem overwhelming if you have\nnever done it before, but don’t fear or fret because all it takes is simply trying it.\nPurchase the gear and supplies you think you’ll need for your gelcoat’s condition.\nTake it all down to your boat and spread everything out in the cockpit or on the aft\ndeck. You’re going to do test spots in this area because it’s easy to reach, and it’s an\nideal place to lay out all your gear for quick use, and it’s easy to look at from many\ndifferent angles.\nOn 1 foot by 1 foot sections, test various waxes and techniques, by hand and\nwith a buffer. In fact, make this first workday simply a test day, testing everything\nuntil you get the result you’re looking for. Bring a notebook and write down what’s\nworking, as well as a few tips and tricks you learn along the way just by doing. This\nway, you’ll be able to look at those notes to see exactly what worked best instead of\nwondering what it was you did in the third test square that worked so well.\nWhen working with a power buffer, it’s always best to hold the buffer pad flat\nagainst the gelcoat rather than at an angle. Holding it at an angle can cause swirl\nmarks. While holding it flat, apply a medium amount of pressure on the machine.\nYou shouldn’t just be holding the buffer delicately against the gelcoat, but neither\nshould you be leaning into it with all your weight. Find a happy medium, and that’s\nthe amount of pressure you want to apply on oxidized areas.\nThe buffer will grab and jerk around when the buffer pad gets gummy with\nwax. If you’re buffing off compound or cleaner wax on an oxidized boat, however,\nyou have to buff it off while it’s still a little wet, and this will cause the buffer pad to\ngum up quickly. Keep a spur nearby, and periodically run it through the pad while\nrunning the buffer to release the clumps of wet wax buildup. Keep several clean\npads on deck so you can change them often when one gets too gummy. A book can\ntell you only so much about how to wax your boat with a buffer. Every boatbuilder\nuses a slightly different gelcoat formulation, every boat has a different level of oxi-\ndation, and you can never predict the weather, so there’s no one way to do it exactly\nright for all boats. Practice is king!\nDon’t worry if you feel like your dock neighbors are watching you. They prob-\nably are, and they’re most likely thinking you know what you’re doing simply\nbecause you’re out there doing it and are hoping to learn a thing or two by watch-\ning. Just keep working, and very soon you will know what you’re doing!\n\nWaxing Your Boat 49\nMaintaining a Painted Topcoat on Fiberglass\nMany of today’s larger custom fiberglass boats and yachts are coated with Awlgrip\nor another two-part polyurethane paint rather than gelcoat. Additionally, many\nolder fiberglass boats have their decks and hull topsides painted when the gelcoat\ncan no longer be restored with compound and wax. Awlgrip is frequently used in\nthis application, too, but so are other two-part polyurethanes, modified one-part\nurethanes, and even ordinary marine alkyd enamels (which work fine on wooden\nboats, though they might need to be renewed each year or every two years, and last\nlonger on fiberglass, which doesn’t swell, contract, and work as wood does). I focus\nhere on Awlgrip because I’ve had the most experience with it, but my comments\napply to other painted fiberglass surfaces as well. The bottom line is that painted\nfiberglass surfaces should not be waxed.\nAwlgrip provides long-lasting, high-gloss coverage; has excellent resistance to\nsun, salt water, chemicals, and abrasion; and doesn’t require much maintenance.\nOver time, however, a buildup of dirt, grease, and other contaminants can dull the\nfinish. This section provides some simple tips to help you keep your Awlgrip look-\ning its best for a long time.\nWashing Awlgrip\nWhether the finish is gelcoat or Awlgrip, it is best to wash any boat on a fairly regu-\nlar basis (at least once a month) to help keep water stains, bird and spider drop-\npings, road dust, and other pollutants from setting in. Regular cleaning will also\navoid buildup of dirt, grease, and other contaminants, which can cause Awlgrip\nto age prematurely. This premature aging is what causes the finish to appear dull.\nUse a soft mitt or brush on the end of a long-handled pole, and rinse it out thor-\noughly before you start to make sure there are no small pieces of debris (a pebble,\ngrain of sand, or piece of shell) from the last wash that could scratch the painted\nfinish. As for soap, Awlgrip’s manufacturer makes a soap specifically for an Awlgrip\nfinish. It’s called Awlwash (who would have guessed?), and you can buy it at most\nboat supply stores or order it online through the company’s website.\nAwlwash does not contain alkalies, acids, or abrasives, and that’s why it’s spe-\ncifically recommended for use on an Awlgrip finish. However, other boat soaps can\n\n50 The Insider’s Guide to Boat Cleaning and Detailing\nbe used on Awlgrip without hurting the finish. Read the label to check for alkalies\nor acids, and make sure the label says that the soap is safe for painted finishes. It is\nbest not to use soap with wax in it on an Awlgrip finish. Pour one or two capfuls of\nsoap in a bucket, add water, and you’re good to go! While washing, it is important\nto keep the surface wet and to rinse well to prevent the soap from drying on the\nsurface. You should follow up with a squeegee or chamois to remove water spots, or\nattach a water filter between the hose and the water source to prevent water spots\nfrom forming once the water evaporates.\nProtecting Awlgrip\nAwlgrip’s manufacturer has created another maintenance product, called Awlcare,\nthat can be applied to an Awlgrip finish just as wax is applied and used on gelcoat\nfinishes to remove pollutants, protect the finish, and provide a glossy shine. Awl-\ncare is a hand-applied, non-abrasive, synthetic polymer used to seal and restore\ngloss to a painted surface dulled by age or mistreatment. It will remove mild stains,\nwater spots, and diesel soot and, when applied regularly, will increase resistance\nto attack from acid rain and other pollutants. It contains no harsh abrasives and\ntherefore will not scratch the painted finish. Awlcare leaves a non-yellowing, pro-\ntective polymer coating that lasts through multiple washings. Never apply Awl-\ncare with a machine buffer. It can be removed with Awl-Prep Plus when it’s time\nto repaint.\nTraditional waxes are not recommended for use on Awlgrip finishes. These\nwaxes break down rapidly on Awlgrip, and the residue can cause the topcoat to\nappear yellow—plus it attracts dirt. This creates the need to maintain the wax,\nincreasing overall maintenance. Traditional waxes, which contain no abrasives,\nprobably do little harm to the coating, but neither do they offer any benefit. And\nwhen the surface needs to be repainted—as it inevitably will after eight to nine\nyears if not sooner—any wax you’ve applied will need to be removed before the\nsurface can be sanded and prepped for painting.\nCleaning Marks and Stains on Awlgrip\nOver time, marks and stains are bound to appear on your beautiful finish. Black\nscuff marks from shoes, green marks from hoses, grease, handprints, bird drop-\nping stains, and more will accumulate with time. With a gelcoated boat, you would\n\nWaxing Your Boat 51\nsimply use some cleaner wax to remove these stains, but with Awlgrip, a quick hit\nwith cleaner wax isn’t the best solution. Although Awlgrip makes a product (called\nAwl-Prep Plus) that can be used to remove marks and stains on an Awlgrip finish,\nit may not be easy to find at your local boating store. In its place, it is possible to use\ntoluene, lacquer thinner, methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), acetone, or kerosene to soften\nor remove a heavy buildup of grease and grime.\nWhen using solvents to remove stains, test an inconspicuous area first. Apply\nthe solvent with a soft, clean cloth and wipe up quickly. Do not allow the solvent to\ndry on the surface or puddle and soak into the surface. Afterward, rinse well with\nwater to remove any residue. The above-named solvents are aggressive and toxic\nand should be used with proper skin and breathing protection. On the less harm-\nful side, you can use distilled white vinegar and hot water to remove stubborn salt\nstains, but rinse well with fresh water when finished.\nHere are a few don’ts from Awlgrip (which you can find on the company’s\nwebsite):\n \nDo not use abrasives, magic, or rubbing compounds on an Awlgrip fin-\nish. Scratching the surface gives dirt a place to cling while wearing out the\nresin layer. Using abrasives of any kind will reduce the life of the finish.\n \nDo not allow contact between Awlgrip and teak cleaners. Most teak clean-\ners contain acids or caustic agents that stain and discolor an Awlgrip\ntopcoat.\n \nDo not allow metal polishes to dry on an Awlgrip finish because these pol-\nishes may discolor and stain the painted surface. Metal polishes contain\nacids, and rainwater and dew running off metal fittings can spread metal\npolish residue onto an Awlgrip surface and etch and dull the paint. Wash-\ning freshly polished metal fittings thoroughly with soap and water can\nhelp eliminate polish residue and reduce the metal polish runoff.\n \nDo not allow wet gear (for example, seat cushions, coils of line, sails, sail\ncovers, coolers) to trap and hold moisture against an Awlgrip topcoat. This\ncondition can result in blistering or delamination of the painted finish.\nMaintaining an Awlgrip finish may sound like a lot of work, but the main\nthing to focus on is to wash your boat at least once a month throughout the year\nand after each return from a saltwater outing. This is the best and easiest way to\nkeep an Awlgrip finish looking good for years.\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\n53\nC h A p t e r \n3\nTeak Decks\nIf your boat has teak decks, you can appreciate the beauty of honey-colored wood\nthat looks golden when wet or even the distinguished beauty of naturally aged gray\nwood. Although some people don’t mind the weathered look and even prefer it\nover the golden honey color, if your teak has dark stains from oil, grease, or dirt,\nit should be cleaned and brightened to maintain the integrity of the decking. This\nchapter covers the following information on maintaining your teak decks:\n \nWhy and when to clean teak decks\n \nGear and supplies\n \nPreparation and safety\n \nCleaning teak decks—step-by-step\n \nOiling teak decks\nWhy and When to\nClean Teak Decks\nYou’ll know it’s time to clean your teak\ndecks when they start looking gray or\ndevelop dark stains from grease, oil,\nor dirt. It’s not a serious situation if\nthey start turning gray, but the main\nthing you’re trying to prevent is the\nactual breakdown of the teak and its Teak with grease stain\n\n54 The Insider’s Guide to Boat Cleaning and Detailing\nunderlayer. Older teak decks that are\nwell weathered typically have a more\nopen grain on the surface than newer\nteak decks. You’ll know if the grain\nof your teak is “open” if you can feel\nridges when you run your fingers over\nit against the grain. You can also see\nthese ridges fairly easily. Consider that\nif the grain of your teak decks is open,\nthe dirt, salt, and grease that end up on\nyour decks are getting into the grain of\nthe teak. Once those particles have set-\ntled into it, it’s impossible to get them\nout without scrubbing, thus opening\nup the grain even more. And once the\ngrain is opened, it’s open for the life of\nthe teak. It does not close up on its own.\nPreventing this from happening in the\nfirst place if you have new teak decks will help them last a lot longer. Maintaining\nyour teak decks is actually quite simple and doesn’t take a lot of time if you keep\nup with them.\nGear and Supplies\nThere are two main types of teak cleaners on the market—acidic and non-acidic.\nThe non-acidic cleaner usually comes in powder form and is somewhat less harsh\non the teak than the two-step acidic\ncleaners and brighteners. But keep\nin mind that most of the “harshness”\nin teak cleaning comes from using a\ncourse scrub brush rather than a soft\nbrush or going with the grain rather\nthan against the grain. A soft brush\nmakes all the difference! If there are not\na lot of stains in the teak from grease\nand dirt or the teak is fairly new, try\nNote: There are many tips and tricks to cleaning\nand maintaining teak decks, and you’ll find plenty of\nheated discussions in online boating forums about\nthis topic. That’s one thing I love about boats and\ntheir owners. They are usually passionate about their\nboats and how to take care of them. The information\nI cover in this chapter suggests a few of the many\nways you can clean and maintain teak decks; these\nare by far not the only ways.\nNatural gray teak decks look beautiful when free of grease\nstains and dirt particles.\n\nTeak Decks 55\nusing the powder cleaner first. If the teak is older or has several dirt and grease\nstains, use the stronger two-part solution. But first, let’s learn more about what\nyou’re actually putting on the decks.\nTeak Cleaners and Brighteners\nNon-acidic cleaners typically come in the form of a powder that contains an alka-\nline-based cleaning compound, which is still strong enough to clean light dirt\nand grease stains and is somewhat more environmentally friendly than an acidic\ncleaner (or rather the better of two evils). There are also liquid cleaners that don’t\ncontain acid and are advertised to do the job of cleaning and brightening in one\nstep. Once again, if you have newer teak or you’re unsure about which type of prod-\nuct to use, start with one of the non-acidic cleaners.\nThe stronger two-part teak solu-\ntion is made up of Part A (the cleaner)\nand Part B (the brightener). Using these\nproducts is like coloring your hair. Part\nA (which is acidic) basically bleaches or\nstrips a layer of color from the teak, as\nwell as removing dirt and grease, and\nPart B —the base—neutra lizes that\nacid. When acids and bases are mixed\ntogether, they react to neutralize each\nother if an equal number of hydrogen\nand hydroxide ions are present. When\nthis reaction occurs, salt and water are\nformed.\nHCl + NaOH = NaCl + H \n2 \nO\n(Acid) + (Base) = (Salt) + (Water)\nThis is why it is so important to rinse the decks thoroughly when you are\nfinished working with Parts A and B. A combination of applying the acidic cleaner\nand scrubbing the teak will slightly open the teak and allow crystals to embed in\nthe decks if they aren’t thoroughly rinsed. It’s also why it is better not to clean and\nbrighten teak decks in direct sunlight. The decks can dry too quickly and sun can\nThe two-part teak cleaning and brightening system for\nolder teak\n\n56 The Insider’s Guide to Boat Cleaning and Detailing\ncause any type of crystal (from salt or other chemical residue) to burn or etch into\nthe teak, causing discoloration or a breaking down of the material or fibers over\ntime.\nThere is no need to list specific product brands in this category because all\nboating supply stores carry teak-cleaning products. Your main decision is whether\nyou’re going to use a one-step cleaner (usually in powder form), a one-step cleaner\nand brightener (liquid form), or the stronger two-step cleaner and brightener\n(always in liquid form). Once you’ve chosen the product, the next step is making\nsure you have the right brushes.\nBrushes\nThe right type of brush makes all the difference. Think of teak cleaning and bright-\nening as attacking your innocent teak. It didn’t ask to be drenched with chemicals\nor temporarily discolored. It was fine just sitting there on your boat, protecting\nyour fiberglass decks and preventing you from slipping while walking from one\nend of the boat to the other. And if the chemical cocktail of teak cleaner wasn’t\nenough, it’s about to get scrubbed with a brush to help spread those chemicals\nabout its surface. (It’s not the teak’s fault that your tipsy non-boater friends chose\nto drink their red wine on your beautiful teak or that Duke with Duke’s Engine\nRepair and Mess Making didn’t take off his greasy boots before crossing the teak\ndeck to the engine room.) The least we can do is not open the grain of the teak any\nmore than it might already be, thus exposing the wood to more elements and par-\nticles that will further break it down over time.\nYou’ll need three types of brushes when working with teak. The first is a long-\nhandled pole with a soft deck brush attachment, the same kind you would use on\nsmooth gelcoat. This is the main brush you’ll be using to reach most of the deck.\nThe second is a small hand brush with soft bristles. This brush is used for hard-to-\nreach places where the deck brush can’t fit. The third is a small hand brush (think\nof a large toothbrush) with medium-course bristles that aren’t stiff or feel like plas-\ntic. This is the brush you’ll use to scrub\nthe edges of any teak where mildew has\nformed. Use this brush lightly and try\nto go against the grain rather than with\nthe grain when you scrub.\nTip: Remember, a brush is soft enough for gelcoat,\nplastic windows, and teak if it doesn’t scratch when\nyou run it across your face.\n\nTeak Decks 57\nThe only other cleaning gear you’ll need is a hose, nozzle, and bucket. But\nbefore starting, consider that you’ll be working with chemicals no matter which\ntype of cleaning product you’ve chosen. This warrants a quick discussion about\npreparation and safety.\nPreparation and Safety\nBefore you use these products, either the acidic or non-acidic formula, there are\nseveral important steps you need to take to protect you and the gelcoat from harsh\nchemicals.\nFirst, let’s protect you. When you start to brush these cleaners on your decks,\nthey are going to splatter, so make sure you’re wearing rubber boots. The chemi-\ncals in both solutions can stain clothing, so also make sure that you’re wearing\nan older pair of pants or your rain gear so you don’t ruin a good pair of jeans. This\nis definitely not the project to do quickly before your dinner guests arrive at your\nboat. And most importantly, wear rubber gloves. You will know if any of the chemi-\ncals get on your skin because they will sting or burn badly until you wash them off.\nIt’s always a good idea to protect your eyes when working with any type of chemi-\ncal, so if you have protective eyewear, you should wear it.\nThe next thing you want to protect\nis the gelcoat near the teak decks. While\nbrushing the cleaners over your decks,\nareas near the teak will get splashed\nor sprayed with the chemicals, which\ncan stain gelcoat if they’re not hosed or\nwiped off.\nUsing chemica ls to clea n tea k\ndecks is a project that you’ll do only\nonce or twice a year, so make a point of\ndoing it after you wax your boat. This way, the chemical overspray will sit on top\nof the coat of wax and not “soak” into the gelcoat. If the gelcoat isn’t waxed or you\nhave an Awlgrip or other type of painted finish, have an old rag handy so you can\nwipe the splashed gelcoat clean while waiting for the chemicals to do their job on\nthe teak. Use that rag to also wipe any stainless steel or other metal finish that gets\nsplashed with the chemical cleaner to keep it from staining or etching the metal.\nNote: While you’re working, you’ll invariably get\nsome of the chemical solution on your rubber gloves\n(which is why you’re wearing rubber gloves), but be\ncareful not to accidentally scratch your head or face\nwhile you’re working. And if your cell phone rings, let\nit go to voice mail! Spreading these chemicals around\non your skin or your cell phone will only remind you\nof how badly they burn and sting!\n\n58 The Insider’s Guide to Boat Cleaning and Detailing\nPlan to do this project on a cloudy day or even on a day when it’s misting or\nraining very lightly. You shouldn’t clean and brighten your teak decks on a very\nhot day or in direct sunlight because you don’t want the chemical to dry out on the\nteak while you’re waiting for it to do its work (usually about a three- to five-minute\nwait). And mist or light rain will wash the chemicals off the gelcoat for you.\nCleaning Teak Decks Step-by-Step\nIf you have new teak decks, the best way to keep them clean from the start is to\nwash them when you wash your boat. Use the same long-handled pole and deck\nbrush that you use when washing the smooth gelcoat on your boat, as well as the\nsame soapy water from your bucket that you used on the rest of your boat. Abso-\nlutely do not use a scrubbing brush or anything you wouldn’t use on your smooth\ngelcoat or plastic windows. A rough brush will open the grain of the teak, and that’s\nwhen problems can arise. Another natural way to maintain clean teak is to wash\nit with seawater using a soft deck brush. The salt in the seawater helps the teak\nto retain moisture and stops it from shrinking away from the caulking. But don’t\njust dip your bucket into the seawater at the marina because any oil, fuel, or other\ncontaminates that are seeping out of nearby boats can leave a residue on your teak\nand turn it darker and darker over time. If you’re going to wash with salt water, wait\nuntil you’re under way on a cruise; then carefully scoop a bucket of fresh salt water\nto throw over your decks.\nIf you plan to use a chemical solution, prepare for that treatment in the fol-\nlowing ways, no matter which product you’ll be using. Turn the hose water on\nat your slip and bring the hose to the area where you’ll be working. Wear rubber\ngloves throughout the whole process. Grab your long-handled pole with a soft deck\nbrush attached, as well as a soft hand brush for hard-to-reach areas. Your goal is\nto have everything you need to do the job ready and with you. You don’t want to\nhave started brushing Part A teak cleaner about your teak decks only to realize that\nyou left the hand brush on the dock box. You’ll end up tracking the chemical on all\nother surfaces you walk on, which means more cleanup and work to keep it from\ndiscoloring teak or staining gelcoat.\nOpen all the bottles of solution so they are ready to pour or squirt. (You may need\nscissors or a utility knife to cut off the tops of the Part A and Part B bottles of the two-\nstep cleaner and brightener.) Once the chemical solution hits the teak, you’ll want to\n\nTeak Decks 59\nwork fairly quickly (with the deck brush\nand the hand brush you’ve assembled)\nto spread the solution around. You’ll also\nwant to make sure to corral the solution\nso it doesn’t run down the sides of the\nhull, and lightly hose any cleaner off the\ngelcoat before it discolors it.\nYou’re now ready to start. Hose\ndown all the teak that you’ll be clean-\ning, as well as the gelcoat and metal\nnear that area. Generously sprinkle the powder or squirt the Part A cleaner over a\nsection that’s about 6 feet by 6 feet. Set the bottle down, then take your long-han-\ndled pole with the soft deck brush and lightly scrub over the area, going against the\ngrain. Remember, you are not trying to scrub hard because the chemicals are doing\nall of the work. Your job is to simply deliver those chemicals to every inch of the\nteak by spreading them about with your soft deck brush. Once you have covered\nthis 6 x 6 section, start on another 6 x\n6 section while the chemicals do their\nwork on the first section (about three to\nfive minutes, depending on how old or\nstained your teak is). Both the powder\nand the Part A cleaner will turn the teak\na dark cherry red and some areas will\nbecome pulpy. That’s the result we’re\nlooking for, so don’t let it worry you.\nOnce you’ve spread the powder\ncleaner or the Part A cleaner on all of\nthe areas you want to clean, take your\nhose and spray it off. Consider that the\nchemical will be running out of drains\nor openings and may run down your\nhull. To prevent staining, every now and\nthen lean over the rail and spray down\nthe hull in any areas where the chemi-\ncal comes in contact with the gelcoat.\nNote: If you want to clean and brighten a teak ladder\nor steps that are over a teak deck, do the steps first.\nThe chemicals will drip down onto the teak deck,\nwhich is fine because you’ll eventually be cleaning\nand brightening the deck below. If you do the steps\nafter the deck, you will stain the deck with the\nchemicals that drip down on it and have to redo it. Be\nsure to apply the teak product on all sides of the step\nfor an even-finished look.\nUse a soft deck brush to spread the product, and always\ngo against the grain.\n\n60 The Insider’s Guide to Boat Cleaning and Detailing\nIf you used the one-step non-\nacidic cleaner, you are finished with\nyour work for the moment. Take a look\nat your decks once they’ve had a chance\nto dry and see if they look any cleaner\n(no grease or dirt stains) or if they are\nhoney colored. If they are only a little\ncleaner or there are still several dirt and\ngrease stains, your decks are ready for the stronger acidic two-step process the\nnext time you schedule this project. Wait a few weeks before treating the decks\nwith the stronger cleaner/brightener solution.\nIf you’re using the two-step process, it’s time to squirt the Part B brightener\nsolution onto the decks. Some two-step teak-cleaning products tell you to squirt\nthe Part B brightener solution onto the decks after applying the Part A cleaner solu-\ntion without hosing it off in between; others suggest that you hose off the Part A\nsolution before applying the Part B solution. I suggest the latter, for two reasons.\nFirst, the Part A solution is a chemical, and the longer it sits on any material (wood,\ngelcoat, metal), the more damage it can do. Second, I have found that there is less\nchance of causing light and dark streaks in the wood if you hose off most of Part\nA before applying Part B. Another way to avoid streaks in the teak when applying\nthe Part B liquid is to pour it in a basket and dip the brush head in there instead of\nsquirting it on the teak.\nTake the same precautions as you took with the Part A cleaner because both\nsolutions contain chemicals that you don’t want touching or soaking into your skin\nor the gelcoat. With your teak decks still wet from being hosed off, squirt the Part\nB solution in 6 x 6 sections, using the soft deck brush to work it in, going against\nthe grain. Let each section sit for three to five minutes, but don’t let it dry. Lightly\nspray water over any section that starts to dry before you’re ready to hose off the\nentire deck. If you see that the wood has turned a light honey color, the brightener\nis doing its job. Hose the decks thoroughly, and remember to hose the side of the\nhull if there is any runoff in that area.\nIf the edges of the teak decks are green with mildew, you can take the mildly\ncourse scrub brush and go over the edges lightly with the brush, scrubbing against\nTip: If you have a lot of teak area to clean, halfway\nthrough your work, take the hose and lightly spray\nover the first sections you worked on. You don’t\nwant the chemical to dry on the deck (especially\nthe powder cleaner) because it could be difficult to\nremove or cause permanent staining.\n\nTeak Decks 61\nthe grain. If that doesn’t remove the\ngreen mildew, spray mildew cleaner\nover the green area and use a soft hand\nbrush to work it in. Rinse well with\nwater when finished.\nAlternative Teak-Cleaning\nMethods\nIn my years of working on boats, I have\nlearned that all you have to do is walk\ndown the dock toting the highly acidic\nPart A in one hand and the alkaline-\nintense Part B in the other hand for boaters on your dock you didn’t even know\nexisted to pop out of the woodwork and pull you aside to tell you what they’ve been\nusing on their teak decks for the last 97 years.\nI gave you step-by-step instructions on how to use the more aggressive two-\nstep teak products above because most people will use them at one time or another\nand those products require the most skill. When using acidic cleaners, there isn’t\nmuch time before mistakes can be made. But there are several alternative methods\nfor cleaning teak that work very well. If you have newer teak decks, I would not rec-\nommend the acidic cleaners because you don’t need them and they’ll be too strong\nfor your tight-grained teak. If you clean your teak decks on a regular basis using\nless aggressive methods, your teak’s grain will do its job better.\nThe alternative method I cover here is simply using soap and water to clean\nyour teak decks. Soap comes in different strengths, and the kind you use will\ndepend on the condition of your teak. If the teak is brand new or still golden in\ncolor, wash the decks with the same soap, water, and soft deck brush that you used\nto wash the rest of the boat. Remember to go against the grain so you don’t risk\nopening up the grain; that is always the main thing you’re trying to prevent no\nmatter what method of teak cleaning you use.\nIf your teak decks are showing some gray or there are oil stains in places,\ntry a stronger soap. I recommend Cascade dishwashing liquid with bleach (if you\nUse a mildew spray and a small scrub brush to remove\nmildew on trim pieces.\n\n62 The Insider’s Guide to Boat Cleaning and Detailing\nmoor your boat in a gray-water marina).\nPour some in a bucket (start with a few\ncups to see how far it goes), then spray\njust enough water in the bucket so the\ndishwashing soap is not as thick. Wet\nthe decks with the spray. Use the long-\npoled soft deck brush to thoroughly\nmi x t he soap solution, t hen spread\nit over the entire deck, going against\nthe grain. Then go back to where you\nstarted to see the results. If the decks\nlook lighter and more golden, hose off\nthe decks. If they seem to need a bit more time, let the mixture sit on the decks for a\nfew more minutes, then hose it off. This soap-and-water method should leave your\nteak decks lighter and brighter without having used a more aggressive product.\nOiling Teak Decks\nTo oil or not to oil, that is the question—and there is no incorrect answer. You can\nleave them honey or gray without oiling them, and the woods’ natural oil will pro-\ntect them, as long as you keep them clean and quickly remove grease or dirt by\nwashing them when you wash the boat or using the cleaner/brightener system\nonce or twice a year. Using teak oil will give them a deep honey color, but they will\nstill require regular maintenance in addition to several extra post-cleaning steps\nto prepare for oiling.\nIf you have decided to oil your teak decks after cleaning and brightening\nthem, you will need to gather a few additional items to start your project. The list\nincludes:\n \nBlue painter’s tape\n \nCotton rags\n \nSandpaper (150 grit)\n \nPaintbrushes\n \nPlastic container\n \nWork gloves and knee pad (for comfort and to prevent splinters)\nAn alternative teak-cleaning method for newer teak\n\nTeak Decks 63\nIt’s time to start preparing the teak, assuming that your teak decks do not\nneed repair work before you coat them with oil. If there are chips in the wood or\nplaces where the wood has separated from the caulking, then repair work on those\nareas should be done before you apply oil. If you are uncertain about doing this\nyourself, you should contact a brightwork or teak specialist to do the work for you.\nWhole books could be written (and many have been) on how to repair or resurface\nteak decks. Because my specialty is detailing rather than repair work, I gladly leave\nthat topic to an expert in the field.\nStart by sanding the teak with sandpaper to smooth out any ridges, but don’t\nsand so hard or so much that you remove all ridges to a perfectly flat finish. Because\noiling your teak decks necessitates sanding every time you do it, which could be\nevery few months in sunnier climates like Florida or the Caribbean, that’s a lot of\nsanding for the life of the decks, even if it’s only every six months in a less sunny\nlocation. Your goal with sanding is to take out the most extreme ridges and leave a\nslightly smoother finish on the grain.\nOnce you have finished sanding, hose the decks down thoroughly and let\nthem dry completely. If you don’t have time for this, at least vacuum the dust out\nof the grain. Use painter’s tape to tape off anything that shouldn’t be oiled, such as\nmetal fittings and stanchions, gelcoat, and varnished wood rails. However, this is\nwhy you should keep cotton rags handy, in case you need to quickly wipe teak oil\noff something it wasn’t intended for.\nYou might find it easier to decant the teak oil from the bottle it came in to a\nplastic container for easier dipping with a paintbrush. Then use the brush to paint\nthe teak oil on the deck, going with the grain. Avoid getting the oil on the caulking.\nWipe it off with cotton rags as you go. “Paint” your way off the boat, then allow the\nteak oil to soak in and cure completely so it is no longer wet or tacky. All teak oil is\nslightly different, so see what length of dry time the manufacturer recommends on\nthe bottle. One thick coat is enough and should last three to six months depending\non your climate, how much you use your boat, and where it is moored. Obviously if\nit is moored in a sunny climate or salt water or you use your boat often, the teak will\nneed to be re-oiled every few months for a perfect finish. If you have a covered slip,\ndon’t use your boat as often, or moor it in fresh water in a not-so-sunny climate, a\nperfect finish should last a bit longer.\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\n65\nC h A p t e r\nBrightwork\nMaintenance\nDon’t varnish it. Don’t oil it. Just paint the rails brown. End of story. Now, let’s get\nback to the game. Oh, you did that last year, you say? Well, let’s see if we can’t come\nup with some maintenance tips and advice to help keep your wood protected and\nlooking good. This chapter is mostly about varnishing wood, but it does mention a\nfew other types of coatings for use on exterior wood. I divide this chapter into a few\neasily digestible sections. This chapter covers:\n \nComparing exterior wood finishes\n \nDetermining the condition of your current finish\n \nGear and supplies\n \nPreparation and safety\n \nGetting started sanding and\nvarnishing\n \nCaring for varnished wood\nComparing Exterior\nWood Finishes\nThere are several different ways to care\nfor the wood on your boat, including\neverything from covering it with mul-\n4\nSome boaters varnish rails and some leave them natural.\n\n66 The Insider’s Guide to Boat Cleaning and Detailing\ntiple coats of varnish to leaving it bare. The following is a brief comparison of the\nmost commonly used exterior wood finishes.\nVarnish\nMost everyone loves the look of glossy varnish on a boat’s rails and trim. It’s what\ngives the boat that timeless look of a traditional seafaring vessel. Maintaining that\nlook, however, takes more time than most people have. The decision to varnish\nexterior wood is balanced by the protection it offers versus the ability to maintain\nit on a regular basis so it can do its job.\nVarnish is typically made up of five ingredients, which include oil, resin, sol-\nvent, dryers, and ultraviolet additives, all of which have an effect on how long the\nvarnish will last and how well it will protect the wood from the elements. Here’s a\nlist of these ingredients to give you an idea of what to look for when shopping for\nexterior varnish.\n \nTung oil is commonly used, which provides long-term resistance to crack-\ning and crazing. The main purpose of tung oil is to improve penetration\ninto the wood; the more oil in a varnish, the better the penetration.\n \nResins, which are derived from natural sources (tree stumps or crude oil),\nhelp varnish dry faster and give it a hard finish that is more resistant to\nwater and other elements.\n \nSolvents aid in the leveling process of varnish. They help varnish lie down\non the wood, so brushstrokes are not as visible.\n \nDriers simply help accelerate the drying time and improve the hardness of\nthe coating.\n \nAdditives are used in varnish to improve the finished cosmetic look and\nmake the varnish last longer to protect the wood. Different additives that\nmay be used include anti-skinning agents, flattening agents (typically used\nfor interior varnishes), and ultraviolet additives so that any UV light enter-\ning the coating is diffused back.\nMost varnishes contain all of these ingredients, but some higher quality var-\nnishes take it a step further and provide longer-lasting protection. Interlux Gold-\n\nBrightwork Maintenance 67\nspar Clear or Schooner 96 varnishes use three different additives to combat UV\nlight. An ultraviolet absorber (UVA) reflects most of the light away from the wood;\nthe remaining UV rays that are not reflected back are dispersed evenly throughout\nthe coating so there is no single attack on the film. A surface stabilizer works at the\nsurface to repair damage from UV light. By keeping the surface film repaired and\nstabilized, the amount of water, which can attack a broken paint film, is reduced,\nprolonging the life of the coating. Antioxidants are the third additive; they are used\nto combat photodegradation and the effects of oxidation on the varnish film. With-\nout an effective antioxidant, the varnish will gradually fade and become cloudy.\nWith any clear coating, like varnish, it is particularly important to maintain its\ncolor because any change will be readily detectable. (This information is from the\nInterlux website—www.interlux.com.)\nTwo-Part Catalyst Systems\nFor boaters who don’t have the time, energy, patience, and perfect weather, and\nwho don’t love sanding as much as they thought they would, there are now several\ntwo-part varnish products on the market that allow you to apply all the coats in\none weekend. These two-part catalyzed urethane coatings include Honey Teak (by\nSignature Finish), Bristol Finish, and Perfection Varnish (by Interlux).\nThese varnishes can be used on bare wood or wood that has been varnished\npreviously and simply needs new coats built up. The products contain a catalyst\nthat cures the resin into a highly durable surface, and their molecular cross-linking\nensures a perfect bond between coats with little or no sanding and a much faster\ndry time, so you can apply the next coat in just one to two hours. These catalyst\nsystems look the same as varnish when dry and have additives just like varnish\nthat protect against UV rays, abrasives, and chemicals coming into contact with\nthe finish.\nThe slight downside to using these types of products is that you have to fol-\nlow the instructions very carefully in preparing the mixture of the urethane base\nwith the catalyst. And because these products are thinner than varnish and don’t\nhave the leveling agents that varnish does, you have to apply them more carefully\nand mind your brushstrokes. You cannot just “slap it on” as you can with varnish\nbecause they won’t level as well as varnish will. Because this chapter mostly dis-\n\n68 The Insider’s Guide to Boat Cleaning and Detailing\ncusses the application of varnish, you should use the instructions provided with\nthe two-part system if you plan to use this type of coating for your wood. All of\nthese companies provide detailed instructions that are easy to follow, and they\nhave helpful and convenient phone and Internet support.\nOil\nOil, such as tung or linseed oil, is easy to apply (just wipe it on with a rag or use\na foam brush) and gives the wood a deep, rich color (the oil darkens in sunlight).\nBut because it penetrates deeply into the wood, leaving less of a surface finish, it\ndoesn’t do a very good job of actually protecting the surface of the wood, and it\nallows UV rays to do damage over time. In most sunny climates, oil usually lasts\nfor less than six months and requires re-coating several times a year to effectively\nprotect the wood.\nSynthetic Finishes\nThese types of finishes (such as Cetol, by Sikkens) are like your Uncle Clem who\nlives in a van down by the river—strong, but not always the most attractive choice.\nIf you don’t mind the color of pumpkins, Cetol has many benefits: it lasts a long\ntime, it’s very durable on exterior wood, it offers UV protection, and it’s easy to\napply and maintain. If your rails are already coated with Cetol and are in good con-\ndition, then by all means simply maintain the finish with a few new coats through-\nout the year (more often if you’re in a tropical or sunny climate), and maybe even\napply Cetol Overcoat to give the rails a glossy finish. After an initial sanding, you\ncan apply several coats of Cetol without sanding in between coats, waiting only 24\nhours or less to apply the next coat.\nEpoxy\nI don’t go into much detail about epoxy because a book specifically about bright-\nwork would cover this topic in full. However, using epoxy on bare wood before\napplying varnish offers many benefits, especially in the way that it seals wood and\nprotects it from water. Some of the companies that offer epoxy resins are West Sys-\n\nBrightwork Maintenance 69\ntem and Interlux. The following benefits and uses of epoxy resins as suggested by\nWest System include:\n \nUsing a resin and clear hardener as a base can give your brightwork a richer\nlook while protecting it longer without having to apply as many coats of\nvarnish.\n \nBecause there are no solvents evaporating away from the epoxy, it builds\nthickness faster per layer than varnish and it doesn’t shrink when it cures.\n \nSealing wood with an epoxy moisture barrier dramatically lessens its\nstretching and shrinking, helping the varnish last longer because it’s on a\nstable surface.\n \nUndercut the wood trim around all edges by ¼ inch and glue the edges\ndown with epoxy to eliminate places where water can get in.\n \nApply epoxy to screw holes prior to running the screws in place to prevent\nwater from seeping in.\nDetermining the Condition of Your\nCurrent Finish\nAssuming that you are planning to apply varnish as opposed to another type of\nfinish and that you are working with bare wood or previously varnished wood, the\nnext step is to determine the condition of the wood and the condition of the cur-\nrent varnish. It is not you who will make this decision, but rather the wood that will\ndetermine what you need to do—build up more coats, patch-coat it, or take it down\nto bare and start anew. The following “cheat sheet” can help you decide which of\nthe three options your wood requires.\n \nIf the wood still has a solid covering of varnish (no areas of bare wood or\ndiscoloration) but has simply lost its gloss, the varnish is simply thinning\nand all you need to do is build up new coats of varnish on the wood.\n \nIf you can see small areas of bare wood through the current varnish or\nareas where the wood has turned dark gray or black, or the varnish has\nbecome discolored around stanchions and other metal parts, you can iso-\n\n70 The Insider’s Guide to Boat Cleaning and Detailing\nlate these problem areas with tape and\nthen patch-coat them.\n \nIf the current varnish is peeling or\nblistering, the underside of the rails\nfeels rough or has been worn down to\nbare wood, or the current varnish has\nyellowed or looks faded, the varnish\nhas gone too long without proper main-\ntenance and is no longer protecting the\nwood from harmful UV rays, salt spray,\nor water. In this case, it’s best to take the wood down to bare and apply new\ncoats of varnish.\nGear and Supplies\nThe following gear and supply list includes everything you might need to varnish\nwood in any condition. The better the condition of your wood, the fewer items\nyou’ll need.\n \nSandpaper. It’s best to buy several\ndifferent grits, ranging from 50 to 320.\n \nSanding block or sponge. A sanding\nblock helps you sand more evenly over a\nlong, flat surface; sanding sponges help\nyou sand curved areas.\n \nScrapers. Buy a couple of different\nsizes; scrapers with rounded corners\nare preferable. W hile you’re buying\nscrapers, grab a file to help keep them\nsharp.\n \nTape. Use painter’s tape so it comes\noff easily. Do not leave it on longer than\na few days, especially if it has rained. (If you do end up with tape residue\non the fiberglass, apply 3M Adhesive Remover with a rag to take it off.)

Use them just\nbefore applying varnish.\n \nDenatured alcohol, acetone, or\nMEK. Use denatured alcohol\nto wipe down wood just before\nyou apply varnish. Use acetone\nor MEK to remove varnish drips\nthat land on other surfaces.\n \nBr u s he s . L o ok f or q u a l i t y\nbrushes meant for varnish. The last thing you want are little brush hairs\ncoming out of a cheap brush and drying in your smooth varnished rails.\n \nTarp or drop cloth. Lay out a tarp or drop cloth and put all of your gear\non top of it rather than directly on your decks or nonskid. The tarp will\ncontain the inevitable spills and drips, as well as any sharp objects. It also\ngives you a specific area to place gear and supplies, which makes it easier\nto find things and much easier to clean up.\n \nPlastic containers. These are ideal for decanting varnish from its original\nlarge container so you can more easily hold it in one hand while you move\nabout the boat. Plastic containers are also handy for holding used brushes,\nrinsing out brushes, and holding small screws and other hardware that\nyou may have had to temporarily remove.\n \nFinishing sander. If you have large areas of flat wood, a sander will quickly\nbecome your best friend. Not only does it speed up the process, it can sand\nthe wood with more even pressure than your fingertips can, and it will be\neasier on your hands and wrists for large jobs.\n \nChemical stripper. I don’t recommend chemical strippers simply because\nthey’re toxic to the skin and lungs. However, they do the job, and they’re\nuseful for removing varnish from large areas or areas that are difficult to\nreach or fit into with a sander.\nVarnish gear\n\n72 The Insider’s Guide to Boat Cleaning and Detailing\n \nBleach or oxalic acid. You’ll need one of these products to remove water\nstains from the wood.\n \nHeat gun. A heat gun is a good way to strip old varnish without using\nchemicals. You’ll need a scraper to remove the varnish while holding the\nheat gun near it.\n \nVacuum cleaner. You may want to bring a shop vac down to the boat to\nremove any sanding dust in the area where you’ve been working. A breeze\ncan pick up quickly and scatter that dust onto the fresh varnish you just\napplied.\n \nBand-Aids and aspirin. Need I say more?\nPreparation and Safety\nPlanning Your Time\nIn varnishing, preparation is king! It will take you one-tenth the time to actually\napply the varnish; all the rest of the time will be spent preparing your gear, sup-\nplies, and wood. In fact, preparing for\nand applying multiple coats of varnish\ncan take up to several weeks. With this\nin mind, if you don’t have this kind of\ntime and patience or enough perfect\nweather, you may want to consider the\ntwo-part catalyst urethanes.\nW h ichever t y pe of f i n ish you\nchoose, preparation is still the most\nimportant part. For example, if you\nhave a full Saturday and part of the fol-\nlowing afternoon to work, then use all\nof Saturday to prepare the wood by set-\nting up your gear, sanding the wood, and completely cleaning up your work area.\nThe following afternoon, use a tack cloth or denatured alcohol to wipe down the\nwood to remove any dust or other dirt particles that landed since you left, then\napply a coat of varnish. Of course, your schedule, the weather, and collecting or\nbuying all the gear and supplies you’ll need may not always work out as easily as\nthat, but it’s a good way to start planning for this project.\nPreparation is 90 percent of the job.\n\nBrightwork Maintenance 73\nSafety\nSafety is also king, and it’s something to take very seriously when doing this proj-\nect. I cannot stress this enough—wear a face mask whenever you’re sanding! If\nthat fine dust gets into your respiratory tract, it will cause your lungs to physically\nhurt. You should also wear thin latex (or similar) gloves when working with var-\nnish, chemical stripper, bleach, oxalic acid, acetone, or MEK. (However, don’t wear\ngloves of any sort when working with a heat gun.)\nWeather and Other Conditions Beyond Your Control\nBefore you race down to your boat to slap a few coats of varnish on the rails, take a\nminute to check the weather conditions. Avoid applying varnish if there is a chance\nof rain, strong winds, or extreme hot or cold temperatures coming your way. Read\nthe label to learn what the ideal temperature range is for that particular varnish.\nSome varnishes are fine to apply in direct, hot sunlight, while others will become\ntoo sticky or runny in those conditions. (If the forecast is for hot sun for weeks on\nend, add a thinning agent to the varnish to prevent it from going on too thick.)\nLook around to see what’s going on near your boat. Especially on a breezy day,\nmake sure your dock neighbors aren’t washing their boat, doing fiberglass repair\nwork, or waxing their boat. If you know your varnish project is going to take sev-\neral days or weeks (as it most likely will), and you use a detailer to wash your boat\non a regular basis, make sure you let them know about your project so they don’t\nshow up to wash your boat minutes after you’ve left for lunch while the varnish is\ndrying.\nIf you moor your boat next to a bridge that cars travel over, you may want to\nconsider moving your boat to a slip for a few weeks that is farther away from the\nbridge, or to a different marina altogether. You will not be able to achieve a per-\nfectly smooth finish if road debris and dirt particles are constantly settling on your\nvarnish, even if there is no wind.\nGetting Started Sanding and Varnishing\nJust as you should spend more time on preparation than actually applying the var-\nnish, this chapter spends more time on what you need to know before picking up\nthe brush than instructing you on exactly how to do the work. Once you’ve deter-\nmined the condition of your wood and decided which process you’re going to take,\n\n74 The Insider’s Guide to Boat Cleaning and Detailing\nbought all the supplies and set them up on your boat, and checked the weather\nand planned your schedule, you are now ready to begin doing the actual work.\nThis section will help you get started and give you the basic guidelines you’ll need\nto effectively complete the job. However, you might want to read a book written\nspecifically on brightwork, such as Brightwork, by Rebecca Whitman, which goes\ninto complete detail about all the steps, tips, and tricks you should be aware of\nwhen embarking on this project, especially what to do when you run into problem\nareas. Also read the product instructions carefully because some manufacturers\nmay have specific steps you must take in a given order or disclaimers you should\nknow about the product you’re using (for example, what temperature it works best\nin or how long it takes to cure).\nAlso, if you have never varnished wood or worked with a sander, you should\npractice on something other than your rails or name placard because any mistakes\nwill easily be seen in those areas. Try sanding and varnishing your bread board, or\npurchase some small pieces of lumber (preferably the same type of wood as on the\nboat you’ll be varnishing) that you can practice on.\nBuilding Up Coats\nIf your current finish isn’t showing signs of wear and tear and you simply want to\nbuild up more coats (which is recommended every three to nine months depend-\ning on your climate and conditions), you have a fairly straightforward job ahead\nof you.\n1. Light ly sa nd (by ha nd or w it h a\nsander) the current finish with 240-\nor 320-grit sandpaper. You can also\nuse a red or green Scotch-Brite pad.\nYour goal is to lightly scuff up the\ncurrent finish and remove any gloss\nso the new finish will adhere to it.\n2. Brush or vacuum off the sanding\ndust, t hen w ipe t he wood w it h\ndenatured alcohol to remove any\nfine dust or particles.Use a soft block to sand between coats.\n\nBrightwork Maintenance 75\n3. Apply a fresh coat of varnish with a bristle or foam brush or a roller.\n4. Allow to dry (usually 24 hours, but read the label first to see how long it\ntakes to cure), then repeat steps 1 through 3 until you have built up the\ndesired number of new coats.\nPatch Coating\nIf there are only small areas of bare wood or water stains and the rest of the finish\nhas a nice sheen or solidly covers the wood, you can get away with patch-coating\nthose areas. Follow these steps to fix those problem areas:\n1. Outline the area with painter’s tape.\n2. Use 180- or 220-grit sandpaper to sand that area down to clean, bare\nwood. Always wear a face mask when sanding wood.\n3. If there are water stains (where the wood is black or gray), use bleach\nor oxalic acid to remove the stains. Simply rub it on with a rag or apply\nwith a foam brush to saturate the area, then wipe it off with a damp rag\nor rinse with water. Be sure\nto wear protective gloves.\n4. Let the area dr y and then\nuse fine-grit sandpaper (240\nor 320) to sand the wood in\npreparation for varnishing.\n5. After sanding, wipe down\nt he a rea w it h denat u red\na lc ohol, a nd v ac uu m or\nsweep away a ny sa nding\ndust.\n6. Apply one coat of varnish\nto the area using a bristle or\nfoam brush.\n7. Most finishes require you to\nlet each coat dry before lightly sanding with 320-grit sandpaper and\napplying the next coat. Repeat until the repaired area matches the rest\nof the wood.\nSand right up to the stanchions so this area is better\nprotected from water seeping through.\n\n76 The Insider’s Guide to Boat Cleaning and Detailing\nTaking It Down to Bare\nThe current finish on your wood is no longer doing its job if it’s peeling, blistering,\nor fading or if there are several areas of bare wood or water stains. Follow these\ngeneral steps to take the wood down to bare and apply new coats of varnish.\n1. To protect the gelcoat, use painter’s\ntape over the gelcoat where it abuts any\nwood you’ll be sanding.\n2. Completely remove t he cu r rent\nf inish by using one or more of t he\nfollowing methods: a sander or hand\nsa nder, a heat g u n, a scraper, or a\nchemical stripper. If you want to use\na mix of everything available to you,\napply a chemical remover to loosen the\nold finish, let it sit for several minutes\n(read the instructions on the label), and\nrub it off with a 3M or Scotch-Brite pad.\nYou may have to repeat this application a few times depending on how\nmany old coats of finish are on the wood. Wear gloves and a face mask\nanytime you are working with strong chemicals. Follow the chemical\nremover with a scraper (and a heat gun, if needed, but only after you\nhave removed a l l of t he chem ica l\nstripper) to remove old strips of varnish\nthat are still sitting on the wood. They’ll\ncome off fairly easily thanks to the\nchemical remover, so be careful not to\npush too hard on the scraper, and make\nsure the scraper blade is sharp so your\nwork is accurate. Once you’ve reached\nbare wood and 90 percent of the old\nfinish has been removed, use an electric\nsander with 180 grit to sand the entire\narea. Repeat with 220-grit sandpaper.\nOld varnish that is peeling—it’s no longer protecting the\nwood and is causing water stains\nUse a heat gun and scraper to remove old varnish on trim\nand smaller areas.\n\nBrightwork Maintenance 77\n3. C h e c k t h e p h o n e b o o k\nfor a varnisher who is (a)\naffordable and (b) available\nin the next six months to fix\nthe gouges from the scraper\nand the burn marks from\nthe sander. (Sorr y, I don’t\nmean to assume the worst.\nI’m sure you’re doing just\nfine and are not frustrated at\nall and are looking forward\nto twelve more continuous\nhours of sanding before the\nrains come.)\n4. Decide if you need to use any wood fillers or epoxy to fill any uneven\nareas or fill a seam where two pieces of wood meet to better protect that\narea from water seeping in. Let the filler or epoxy dry completely before\nsanding smooth.\n5. Now, follow steps 3 through 7 above under “Patch Coating.” Your goal\nshould be to build up at least four coats of varnish, but more if you have\nthe time and opportunity.\nOf course, when you look at the\nactual condition of the wood on your\nboat and notice all of the small trim\npieces, the ornate designs in the wood,\nand the number of stanchions you have\nto tape and varnish around, these steps\naren’t going to seem as simple as they\ndo on paper. The key is to not rush\nthrough it. Plan to do one section at a\ntime and figure out a realistic schedule\nthat works with your free time and the\nweather.\nA rail sanded down to bare wood\nSpotlight on Brightwork\n”If you haven’t varnished wood before, find a small\nsection on your boat—a one foot section on the rail, a\nhatch or a small section of trim—and do the complete\nprocess on that one section. Strip it, bleach it, sand\nit, clean it, varnish it and then build up a few coats.\nYou’ll learn quickly in one small manageable section\nhow to varnish wood, the results you can get and\nwhat to expect when you move on to the rest of the\nwood. And it makes for a much less daunting project\nif you cut your teeth on a small area first and then\nmove on to the rest of your rails or trim once you’ve\nbuilt up a few coats and some confidence.”\n—Holly Gibson, Golden Touch Yacht Care (www.\ngoldentouchyachtcare.com)\n\n78 The Insider’s Guide to Boat Cleaning and Detailing\nCaring for Varnished Wood\nOnce you’ve finished this project and you have beautiful varnished wood, your\nnext step is to actively take precautions that will keep it looking that way for as\nlong as possible. The best way to protect varnished rails is by having canvas covers\nmade for them and keeping the covers on except when you’re cruising or enjoy-\ning the boat in its slip. Having custom\ncanvas covers made can be expensive,\nbut the added protection they give your\nvarnished rails will make a huge differ-\nence in how often you have to refinish\nthe wood.\nYou can use wa x on varnished\nwood for the same reasons you would\nuse it on gelcoat—to protect it from\nharmful UV rays, clean it, and seal it.\nUse a pure carnauba paste or liquid wax\nthat contains no rubbing compound.\nApply a light coating w it h a sma ll,\nround foam or terry cloth wax applica-\ntor pad (available at any boating supply store or a store that sells auto detailing\nproducts). Let it dry to a haze and then wipe it off with a clean, dry microfiber rag.\nWater will now bead up on the varnished wood, so it will be protected from and\nhelp repel salt spray.\nWhen washing your boat, be careful about pulling the hose over any var-\nnished rails because this can easily scratch the varnish. Instead, run the hose\nunder varnished rails. Or, if you have varnished toe rails, secure a cotton rag or\ntowel over the rail where the hose will come in contact with it. This is another\nreason why having canvas covers on your rails is a good idea—to prevent the hose\nfrom scratching or marring the finish.\nA hose or power cord can easily scratch varnished rails.\n\n79\nC h A p t e r \n5\nInterior Cleaning\nCleaning the interior of your boat is similar to cleaning the interior of your house,\nbut in a much tighter space and most likely with a lot more nooks and crannies.\nThis isn’t the most exciting chore you’ll want to tackle on your boat, but a clean\ninterior can result in a much more comfortable experience when entertaining\nguests or staying the night on your boat. The best way to tackle this chore is to\nmake sure you have a working radio nearby and some rubber gloves. Both will help\nyou get through this project unscathed! This chapter covers:\n \nDeep cleaning versus maintenance cleaning—when and why\n \nGear and supplies\n \nDeep cleaning\n \nMaintenance cleaning\n \nHiring a cleaning service\n \nOrganizing for small spaces\nDeep Cleaning Versus Maintenance\nCleaning—When and Why\nTwice a year, preferably in spring and fall, you should do a deep cleaning on your\nboat. The rest of the time, a maintenance cleaning should suffice. What exactly is\na deep cleaning? It’s when you actually lift up the seat cushions, look under things,\nand use your Q-Tips and old toothbrushes so you can clean every inch of the inte-\nrior. A maintenance cleaning is when a rag and a spray cleaner will do most of the\n\n80 The Insider’s Guide to Boat Cleaning and Detailing\nwork. If you haven’t cleaned the interior of your boat in a while, a rag and spray\ncleaner won’t get the interior truly clean or smelling fresh. You first need to tackle\nthe problem areas the way only a deep cleaning can do. This may require a full\nweekend, so be prepared to set aside some time to complete this task. It may also\nrequire a few trips to the dry cleaners or hiring a carpet cleaning service. Deep\ncleaning isn’t difficult work, but it can be somewhat tedious and requires an eye for\ndetail. A radio program playing in the background or help from a talkative friend\nwill make the job go much faster!\nA maintenance cleaning is something you should do after each cruise, or once\na month if you’re not using your boat often. Even if there’s no one around to see it,\ndust still happens! So does mildew growth and stale smells caused by moisture\nin the air. A maintenance cleaning is where you’ll dust or wipe down all surfaces\nand check for mildew or other growth in the head area. If you check often enough,\nyou’ll catch any sort of growth before it becomes a problem and causes more work\nand musty smells. Also, if you do a maintenance cleaning to the interior of your\nboat once a month, you’ll most likely also catch anything unusual during winter or\nrainy months, such as water leaking through a window. You’ll be able to catch and\ncorrect a problem like this before it causes more extensive cleaning or repairs.\nGear and Supplies\nA lot of the gear and supplies you’ll use to clean the interior of your boat can come\nfrom your own arsenal of house cleaning supplies (this is the one place where\nit’s all right to use household products on your boat). Before you leave the house,\nassemble the following items to take to your boat. If you don’t have these on hand,\nyou can buy them at any grocery or variety store and won’t have to make an out-\nof-the way trip to your local boating-supply store on your way to the dock. Besides,\nboating-supply stores carry a limited selection of cleaning products for use on\ninterior surfaces, and they charge much more for them.\n \nGarbage bags\n \nRubber gloves\n \nMultipurpose spray cleaner for counters and windows (such as Windex or\nSprayWay)\n \nSpray cleaner for grease (such as 409)\n \nMildew spray cleaner without bleach\n\nInterior Cleaning 81\n \nOrange oil wood cleaner/conditioner (for use on real wood paneling only)\n \nMurphy Oil Soap (for use on wood floors)\n \nPortable vacuum cleaner with attachments (if your boat doesn’t have a\ncentral vacuum system)\n \nMicrofiber rags\n \nPaper towels\n \nScrub brushes\nAlso, wear older clothes that are easy to\nmove in. You’ll be dealing with hard-to-\nreach places and standing in odd posi-\ntions trying to access the far corners of\ninterior storage compartments. Bring\nrubber gloves to protect your hands\nfrom chemicals.\nDeep Cleaning\nBefore you can do successful maintenance cleanings on your boat, a deep clean-\ning is a necessity. If you don’t remove and clean damp and musty cushion covers\nfrom the seat cushions, no matter how often you spray and clean any other area\nof the boat, your entire boat will smell musty and stale. So, let’s start with possible\nproblem areas first, then move on from there.\nIf every time you board your boat, your nose wants to run and hide because\nof that good ole boat smell, you need to find the source of the odor and take care of\nit. If you don’t, it won’t go away. You can cover up those musty or stale smells with\nFebreze for only so long before you realize that the source of the odor may actually\nbe serious or may be causing respiratory problems, as in the case of mold or mil-\ndew. I assume you have had the heads pumped out recently, but if you haven’t and\nyou detect a strong smell (one that you can’t mistake for any other), have the heads\npumped out. Once you’re able to rule this out, try to locate the source of the musty\nsmell. Most likely it will be from damp bed linens, curtains, towels, cushions, or\nother fabrics. Once fabric becomes damp, which can happen from a long, wet win-\nter (Seattleites know what I’m talking about), mildew starts to form in the fibers of\nthe material. You may not see it, but you’ll be able to smell it easily, and the fabric\nmay even feel cool or damp to the touch. If this is the case, mildew is definitely the\nNote: Before you start cleaning, organize the items in\nthe boat cupboards, bookcases, drawers, and shelves\nso you can easily and thoroughly clean those areas.\nBring a plastic container to hold the contents of a\nshelf so you can clean it, then easily put those items\nback.\n\n82 The Insider’s Guide to Boat Cleaning and Detailing\nculprit, or at least one of them. Remove the fabrics, linens, or cushions from the\nboat, then go back into the cabin to see what else you can smell. Carpeting typi-\ncally won’t be the problem unless you know for a fact that water soaked the carpet\nat one point and it never had a chance to fully dry. Also check the bilge areas; water\ncan pool under the floorboards. Lift up the floor hatches and pump out any water\nor soak it up. When there’s no water left, spray Simple Green or 409 in that area and\ndo a final wipe-down with paper towels.\nTake all fabrics and removable cushion covers home and run them through\nthe washer and dryer. You don’t need to put them back on the boat until you plan\nto use the boat again, so if it’s fall or winter when you do this, and if you don’t\nuse your boat much in the winter, put the fabrics in a container and store them at\nhome until you need them on the boat. Take cushion covers that are part of the\ncushion and can’t be removed to your local dry cleaner, rug cleaner, or commercial\nfabric cleaner. They will be able to clean and dry your cushions better than your\nown washer and dryer at home. Ask them to treat the cushions with a stain guard\nas well.\nYour boat should now be free of bedding, cushions, towels, and curtains,\nwhich will make all of those areas easier to clean in and around. The next step is\nvacuuming up all of the crumbs, dirt, dust, and other things you’ve dropped from\nthe last boating season, so you’ll have less to wipe away. When starting an interior\ncleaning job for one of my customers, I vacuum every surface from top to bottom.\nYou’d be surprised at how much easier it is to spray and wipe these areas once\nyou’ve vacuumed up most of the dust and dirt. And if spiders inhabit your boat,\nyour vacuum will easily get rid of them.\nWhile vacuuming, lift up anything that lifts up, such as bench seats and stor-\nage hatches. Vacuum shelves, bookcases, sinks, and cabinets. Use the small vac-\nuum attachment that fits into tight places, and use the brush attachment to go over\nthe walls, wood paneling, and headboards. Your goal is to vacuum up most of the\ndirt and dust so that one pass of a rag with spray cleaner is all you’ll need to get that\narea shiny again.\nDo a thorough job of emptying out your storage compartments. Chances are,\nyou’ll find old cleaning products in there that may be leaking or old metal con-\ntainers that have become rusty. If you had put anything away wet or damp, it may\nhave mildew on it, and that could be one of the sources of the moldy odor. This is\na good time to throw away old products and containers and inventory what you\nhave in your storage compartments. Most likely you won’t need all of those items,\n\nInterior Cleaning 83\nso keep only those you use on a regular\nbasis, and store the rest at home or in\nyour dock box.\nThe galley and the head are other\nareas on the boat where you’ll want to\nspend extra time doing a deep clean\nnow so that maintenance cleanings in\nthe future are actually effective. Open\nall fridge and freezer doors and com-\npartments and empty them if possible. If any water is pooled in the freezer, sop it\nup and make sure to dry it thoroughly. If there is mildew in the fridge or freezer,\nspray those areas with mildew spray cleaner and let it sit while you work on another\narea of the galley. Open the compartment where you store garbage and remove any\nfull garbage bags or containers from the boat. Check around the garbage container\nto make sure garbage didn’t miss the container and fall near it. Spray this area with\na bleach spray cleaner. This type of cleaner kills bacteria, eliminates odors, and\neven removes tough stains.\nGo back to the fridge and freezer and use paper towels to wipe the mildew off\nthe interior surfaces you’ve just sprayed. I suggest paper towels instead of microfi-\nber rags because they can be discarded. Mildew isn’t something you want to take\nhome along with rags destined for the washing machine. Once you’ve wiped all\nmildew off the surfaces and from the crevices with paper towels, you can then\nuse a microfiber rag and a multipurpose cleaner to clean the rest of the compart-\nment. If you don’t plan on using your\nboat soon, turn off the power to the\nfridge and freezer and prop the doors\nopen. Put a container of baking soda in\neach to freshen the interior and control\nmoisture.\nThe head is the other area that\ndefinitely needs deep cleaning. Once\nagain, vacuum inside the cupboards\nand storage compartments and around\nthe toilet. If the shower floor has a wood grate, lift that up and vacuum under it.\nVacuuming will remove 80 percent of the dirt, hair, and grime you would other-\nwise have to clean by hand. If the head is extra dirty or hasn’t been cleaned in a\nTip: It’s always a good idea to clean the interior of\nyour boat with as many windows open as you can or\neven a fan blowing. With the mix of mildew, chemical\nspray cleaners, and dust in the air, you’ll need all the\nfresh air you can get while you clean. If the smell is\ntoo strong for you at times or you feel lightheaded,\ntake a break, step outside, and breathe fresh air for\nseveral minutes to clear your lungs and head.\nTip: When you dry microfiber rags in the dryer, don’t\nuse any type of fabric softener. It will destroy the\nrags’ ability to absorb water. Without fabric softener,\nthey’ll have a lot of static and will cling to one another\n(you’ll have a shocking time pulling them apart fresh\nout of the dryer), but they will be the softest and most\nabsorbent rags you can use for cleaning the interior\nand exterior of your boat.\n\n84 The Insider’s Guide to Boat Cleaning and Detailing\nlong time, spray some orange room freshener in this area. Wear a face mask to\nmake this job a bit more pleasant and easier on your senses.\nOnce you’ve thoroughly vacuumed all areas of the head, empty out cupboards\nand items in the shower and throw away old products that you no longer use or\ncontainers that are leaking. This is where you have to get down and dirty. It’s time\nto don your rubber gloves (if you haven’t already), crank up the radio, assemble\nyour cleaning arsenal, and go to town! Use the bleach cleaner in places where it\nwon’t run down a drain (don’t use any type of bleach cleaner in the toilet). Bleach,\nalthough a very effective cleaner in the head area, will dry out PVC pipes and tub-\ning, causing them to break down or crack over time. Clean the toilet with a marine-\ngrade toilet cleaner that you purchased at the boating supply store. This is the one\narea (involving drainpipes) where you don’t want to use household cleaners.\nUse the bleach or antibacterial cleaner spray to disinfect the shower, around\nthe toilet, and on counters. Use it on the walls around the toilet where toilet water\nhas splashed and made water spots. Use a window cleaner for mirrors, windows,\nand shower doors. Use a multipurpose cleaner along with a scrub brush to clean\nthe floors of the head and the shower (if it’s a nonskid material) and inside cup-\nboards. If you have a shower curtain that has become stained or mildewy, now is a\ngood time to replace it. Once you are finished with this first pass of deep cleaning,\ngo over all surfaces again with a microfiber rag and multipurpose cleaner. This will\nensure that you have removed all dirt, as well as any residue left on surfaces by the\nstronger cleaners.\nIf the interior of your boat has\nwood veneer paneling, use a microfiber\nrag and multipurpose spray cleaner or\nMurphy Oil Soap and spray lightly over\nthe wood, then wipe it clean. If you have\nreal wood paneling (you can tell if it’s\nreal wood as opposed to veneer by the\nexposed grain, which you can feel), use\norange oil wood cleaner/conditioner\nspray and two microfiber rags—one to\nwipe off the orange oil spray and one\nto lightly go back over all of the wood\nyou’ve cleaned to remove any oil resi-\ndue. As the initial rag you’re using to\nClean just as you would at home, but avoid products with\nbleach.\n\nInterior Cleaning 85\nwipe off the spray becomes saturated, use less orange oil spray. A little bit goes a\nlong way.\nSpray the orange oil on a section of wood and wipe it over the grain. Instantly,\nyour wood will shine and any areas of wood that are discolored or scuffed will\nblend in with the rest of the wood. You will get overspray on the floor, so if you\nhave a wood floor, be sure to wipe off the overspray well or it can get quite slippery.\nAfter you wipe down the wood-paneled walls, clean the wood floors with Murphy\nOil Soap to remove the overspray completely. Do not use orange oil spray cleaner\non wood floors because it will make them too slippery. When you finish wiping\noff your first pass of orange oil spray from the wood-paneled walls, use the other\nmicrofiber cloth to wipe all of the wood. The cloth will soak up any oily residue and\nleave the wood grain with a perfect and even shine.\nIt’s best to save carpet cleaning for last because you’ll be walking all over your\ncarpets while you clean, and any overspray of cleaning products will land on them,\nwhich will only attract more dirt. Start\nwith a thorough vacuuming of all car-\npeted areas. Once you remove all loose\ndirt in the carpets, you’ll be able to see\nany stains, marks, or spots that need to\nbe treated. If there are only a few small\nspots or stains, treat them with a carpet\nspot cleaner such as Folex, available at\nmost grocery or variety stores. If there\nare several spots and stains, it’s best to\nuse a professional-grade carpet clean-\ning machine rather than trying to spot-\nclean all of them. This is because spot\ncleaning will make that one spot look\nextra clean against the rest of your pos-\nsibly faded or slightly soiled carpet.\nIf your carpets are beyond spot\ncleaning (and it doesn’t take much for\nthem to fall into this category), it’s best\nto rent a carpet cleaning machine or\nhave a carpet cleaning company pro-\nfessionally clean them with the right\nTip: If your boat is used often, yet you want to\npreserve its carpets for future resale value, install\ncarpet runners that snap to the floor. Any canvas\nservice company can measure and install them for\nyou. Then, a few times a year, simply pull them up\nand clean them in your home washer and dryer. Use\na low heat setting when you dry them so they don’t\nshrink.\nKeep after carpet stains as soon as they occur.\n\n86 The Insider’s Guide to Boat Cleaning and Detailing\nproducts and techniques. This is something you may want to do once a year to\nkeep your carpets looking their best.\nMaintenance Cleaning\nIf you have recently deep-cleaned your boat’s interior, maintenance cleaning will\nbe that much easier and more effective. It can be done quickly and easily after\neach outing. All you’ll need is a vacuum\ncleaner, a few microfiber rags, and a\nmultipurpose spray cleaner. First, vac-\nuum all areas, especially heavily used\nareas such as the head, galley, and car-\npets. Then use a multipurpose spray\ncleaner and microfiber rags to spray\nand wipe all surfaces. If you did a thor-\nough deep cleaning recently, you won’t\nneed to lift every bench seat or hatch\nor bother cleaning every cupboard or\ndrawer. You also won’t need to wipe\ndown all of the wood unless you know\nof a specific area where something was spilled and it touched the wood. A mainte-\nnance cleaning is also a good time to:\n \nEmpty the trash and put a new trash bag in the garbage can.\n \nEmpty the fridge, freezer, and cupboards of half-eaten foods, half-full bev-\nerages, old food, and food other people brought that you have no intention\nof eating.\n \nSquirt a marine-grade toilet cleaner and freshener in the toilet.\n \nSpot-clean carpet stains that occurred recently.\nHiring a Cleaning Service\nAfter reading all of this and realizing you’d rather be doing pretty much anything\nthis coming weekend than deep-cleaning the interior of your boat, you may decide\nto hire a boat detailing service that offers interior cleaning, or a house cleaning\nMicrofiber rags are a great way to quickly clean or dust\nany interior area.\n\nInterior Cleaning 87\nservice. A boat detailer will know how to turn the power on and what types of prod-\nucts to use or not use on your boat. A house cleaner may not. If you decide to use\na house cleaning service, it will be in your best interest to remain on or near the\nboat most of the time to help answer their questions. You’ll need to let them in\nthe boat, show them where the power is (or, better yet, have all light, outlet, fresh-\nwater, and head switches turned on for\nthem), help them get the power back\nwhen their high-amp portable vacuum\nshorts a circuit, and show them how to\nturn the lights on and off and how to\nflush the head. If you can afford it, the\nbest situation would be to find someone\nwho can clean the interior of your boat\non a regular basis and eventually get\nto know your boat so you don’t always\nhave to be there.\nAnd how often is often enough?\nI wou ld recom mend doi ng a deep\ncleaning every spring, then follow it\nup with maintenance cleanings after\neach outing or at least once a month. In\nfall before you stop using your boat as\noften, do a light deep cleaning, empty the fridge and freezer, and remove all seat\ncushions and bedding.\nOrganizing for Small Spaces\nI can’t tell you how many times I’ve been cleaning the interior of a boat when I’ve\nopened up a cabinet or closet, only to have all of the items that were stuffed in there\ncome spilling out onto the counter or floor that I just wiped down. We all know that\nstorage compartments, closets, and cupboards on boats usually don’t offer nearly\nas much room as we need to store all that we want to keep on board. But there are\nways to make the most of the space you have, keep it better organized, and make it\neasy to put things back in their proper place. Here are a few tips and tricks to make\nstoring gear and supplies a little easier.\nUse microfiber rags to clean all stainless.\n\n88 The Insider’s Guide to Boat Cleaning and Detailing\nStorage Containers\nClutter must be contained, and the best way to do that is with plastic containers\nthat you can label. Whether you need them with a lid or open on top, handles or\nno handles, holes or no holes will depend on where they’re going and what they\nwill be used for. Before you run out and buy tubs and bins, look through the items\nyou have in the storage areas of your boat and note which ones you should store\ntogether (for example, all games, decks\nof cards, and puzzles for the kids can go\nin one place) and what size container\nyou’ll need for them. Make a note about\neach type of container so when you go\nto the store to buy them, you’ll know\nexactly what you need.\nSmall storage containers, trays, or\nbins are an ideal way to organize the\nitems you keep in drawers. Just like a\nsilverware drawer, you don’t want all\nof your utensils sliding around; using\na silverware tray makes it much easier\nto keep the utensils organized so you\ncan easily find what you need. Likewise, you could use a similar system for other\ndrawers.\nFor example, if you keep a flashlight, batteries, and small tools in a drawer,\norganize them in bins so it is easier to find what you need when you need it. Noth-\ning will have slid to the back of the drawer, and it will be much easier to clean the\ndrawer or reorganize where you keep things because you need to lift out only one\nor two bins rather than seventeen batteries, five screwdrivers, and thirteen bits.\nIn addition, if one of the items in that drawer leaks or can mark something, keep\nthose items in a container to prevent permanent stains in that drawer. Remember,\nwhen you someday go to sell your boat, you want it to look as clean and new as pos-\nsible. When prospective buyers open up each drawer to look inside, the last thing\nthey want to see is the ink from a broken pen soaked into the wood or the sticky\nresidue from candy with crumbs stuck to it. I see this all the time, and ink stains\nare very hard to clean and usually don’t come out completely.\nA well-organized storage compartment makes it easier to\nfind things and keep clean.\n\nInterior Cleaning 89\nIn the Galley\nThe galley is the best place to use small storage containers for food items and bak-\ning products. Many boaters keep their flour, salt, sugar, and other baking ingredi-\nents, as well as snacks like nuts and chocolate chips, in Ziploc bags. This is a fine\nway to store ingredients that would otherwise take up more space in their original\npackaging. But keep these filled Ziplocs in an airtight plastic bin or container; they\nwill stay fresh longer, and if the Ziploc bag hasn’t been zipped all the way or has a\nhole in it, the inside of the container will be much easier to clean than the inside of\na storage compartment or hard-to-reach shelf.\nAlso remember that boat interiors can get damp in the wet, cooler months.\nThis is another reason why airtight containers are an ideal way to store food items.\nIn fact, you might even take this a step further and rethink the way you store\nspices. Moisture in the air causes spices to clump and lose their flavor and fresh-\nness. When cleaning galleys, I’m always amazed at the vast number of old spices\nstored in a drawer or cabinet. Go through your spice drawer or cabinet and remove\nany that are old or clumpy or not used very often. To save space, buy spice blends\nrather than the individual spices to make the blend. Keep the spice jars in a tray\nor container with low sides so you can remove the whole thing from a drawer or\ncabinet and set it on the table for everyone to choose from. Cleaning the tray or\ncontainer is much easier than cleaning out spilled spices or spice “crumbs” from a\ndrawer or a cabinet that is up high and hard to reach.\nKeeping toiletries in small containers in the head will greatly decrease the\namount of time it takes to clean shelves and cabinets—especially when you have a\ndrippy toothpaste tube or a shampoo spill—and will help you keep things clutter-\nfree. Keep a container with holes in the bottom in the shower with shampoos and\nsoap. This way, everything is contained, but the water will drain through the holes.\nKeep all seasickness remedies in their own container so they are quickly accessible\nand guests on your boat can find them easily. Since toiletries can be messy if they\nleak or spill, this is definitely one area where keeping these items in handy contain-\ners will make cleanup and organization much easier.\nIn your house or on your boat, a junk drawer shouldn’t exist, just as the cat-\negory of “miscellaneous” shouldn’t exist when organizing items for storage. It’s just\ntoo abstract, and eventually everything ends up in the junk drawer. If you find that\nyou don’t have a place for something, you may not need to keep it on the boat, or\n\n90 The Insider’s Guide to Boat Cleaning and Detailing\nyou may not need it at all. Make the decision right then and there to throw it out or\ntake it home with you (or give it to your dock neighbors and let them figure it out).\nIt’s the small random objects collected over time that start to pile up in drawers for\nlack of a better place to put them (like the garbage can). They can drive you mad\nthe day you sell your boat, when it takes you seven hours to remove all of those\nmiscellaneous items from the far corners of each drawer and clean up after them.\nWhen you can look in each drawer, closet, and cabinet and clearly see exactly\nwhat’s in it, can easily clean that area and quickly remove containers to empty out\nyour boat, you will feel less “cluttered” and more organized and in control of your\nspace. Take these organizational tips outside and use them to organize exterior\nstorage spaces where you keep cleaning products and bottles of oil or other greasy\nliquids. This is a good way to prevent spills from dirtying the nonskid or seeping\ninto the teak decks, and it makes cleanup in that storage compartment much easier\nand faster.\n\n91\nC h A p t e r \n6\nCanvas, Carpet,\nVinyl, and Plastic\nWindows\nKeeping your boat’s furnishings clean and well maintained adds to your own\nenjoyment of the boat and also helps increase or at least keep its value in the long\nrun. Pay attention to the details of canvas covers and enclosures, curtains and\nother interior fabrics, interior and exterior carpet, vinyl seats and cushions, and\nplastic windows to keep these materials looking like new. This chapter covers:\n \nCanvas\n \nPlastic windows\n \nOutdoor deck carpeting\n \nInterior carpet\n \nVinyl seats and cushions\n \nInterior fabrics\nCanvas\nChoosing and Buying Canvas\nIf you just bought a new boat and you’re planning to purchase canvas covers or\nenclosures for it, here are a few things to consider before you buy. Canvas covers\n\n92 The Insider’s Guide to Boat Cleaning and Detailing\nand enclosures are expensive, so buy them from a company that will come to your\nboat, measure thoroughly, use a test pattern to make sure the final pieces fit, offer\nyou choices and options, and answer your questions.\nIf you have not purchased canvas covers and enclosures before, think about\nwhat color will look good on your boat, and still look good when it’s been on your\nboat for several years and starts to fade or become dirty. White and light tan will\nshow the dirt much faster than dark colors, but black isn’t a good option because\nit causes heat and humidity to build up inside the enclosed area, which foster the\ngrowth of mildew. Medium shades of blue or green (as opposed to navy or pale blue\nand hunter or light green) tend to look newer longer and don’t cause as much heat\nbuildup.\nYou’ll also want to decide what type of system to use to secure the can-\nvas enclosure to your boat. The two main systems are metal snaps or hooks and\nloops. With metal snaps, a female snap is sewn into the canvas and a male snap\nis screwed into the fiberglass. With the hook and loop system, a plastic hook is\nscrewed into the fiberglass and an elastic loop is sewn into the canvas every 12\ninches or so. The hook and loop system is preferable to metal snaps for the follow-\ning reasons. Over time, canvas—originally measured for a tight fit—can shrink\nslightly from constant wetting and drying in rain and sun. Even slight shrinkage\ncan make it extremely difficult to snap the canvas back into place after it was\nunsnapped. Also, some airflow is desirable in the enclosed area. The tighter the\nfit of the canvas, the less airf low under it, which eventually causes mildew to\ngrow because the underside of the canvas stays wet longer. Even a small amount\nof airflow will help dry the underside of the canvas and deter the growth of mil-\ndew. Lastly, with the hook and loop system, you can use a deck pole to reach a\nloop on the far side of your boat and stretch it over the hook. You can’t do that\nwith the snap system because you have to apply pressure on the snap in order to\nsnap it down.\nGear and Supplies\nYou’ll need a few specific items to clean and protect your canvas from dirt, mildew,\nbird droppings, and other stains that can soak in and ruin the look and the protec-\ntive properties of the canvas. In addition to a hose, nozzle, and bucket, make sure\nyou have the following gear and supplies before you get started:\n\nCanvas, Carpet, Vinyl, and Plastic Windows 93\n \nLong-handled deck brush with a soft brush attached\n \nSoft hand brush\n \nSmall course scrub brush (looks like a very large toothbrush)\n \nMildew spray cleaner such as Lysol or Tilex without bleach\n \nColor-safe bleach (available at grocery stores) or Krazy Clean (available at\nboat supply stores)\nCleaning Mildew in Canvas\nBrand-new canvas can make a boat look new again, but it doesn’t take long for\nnew canvas to start showing dirt and signs of wear. Although you can’t control the\nweather and other external elements that attack your canvas, you can take steps to\nkeep it clean, protected, and looking good for a long time.\nIf your canvas tops and covers are new, don’t wait for their corners to turn\ngreen with mildew before you start cleaning them. Now is the time to put them\non a regular maintenance plan just as you should with the exterior of your boat.\nEvery time you wash your gelcoat with a soft deck brush, use the same brush on\nthe canvas. You don’t need to use any cleaners other than the soap and water that’s\nin your bucket. This will take off the top layer of dirt. If there are several bird drop-\npings in one small area, you can spray them off with the high-pressure setting on\nyour nozzle. This simple procedure will keep the canvas clean for a long time. If\nyour boat is moored in a wet climate (and it’s not in a covered slip), it’s especially\nimportant to prevent and treat mildew when it starts to set in. And it will set in—\nbecause mildew loves canvas, or rather the “ecosystem” that canvas creates.\nYou know the hot, humid air that hits you when you enter a canvas-enclosed\nflybridge in the middle of summer. I’ve always thought an enclosed flybridge would\nbe an ideal place to grow tomatoes. Even in winter, the temperature in an enclosed\nflybridge is considerably warmer than the outside temperature, especially on a\nsunny day. In this “greenhouse” atmosphere, mildew grows easily and quickly.\nYou’ll first start to see a thin layer of it on the underside of the canvas “ceiling.” If\nyou let it go, you’ll then start to see green mildew sprouting in the interior seams\nand rolled edges of the canvas. Finally, you’ll see it growing on the exterior seams\nand eventually on the vertical panels. It doesn’t take much to prevent mildew from\ntaking over the canvas, and if you stay on top of it regularly, you may be able to\nprevent it from growing at all.\n\n94 The Insider’s Guide to Boat Cleaning and Detailing\nThe best defense against mildew is\nto prevent it with a good mildew spray\ncleaner applied every few months. If\nyou live in a dry climate, mildew may\nnot be a big issue for you, but if you live\nin a climate that is often wet or humid,\nf ighting mildew on a reg u la r basis\nwill be necessary in order to maintain\nthe integrity of the canvas and keep it\nlooking good. You’ll find a few brands\nof mildew spray cleaners at your local\nboating store, but these are expensive\nand actually don’t work as well as those\nyou’ll find at the grocery store. Two of the best mildew spray cleaners are Lysol\nand Tilex. Avoid the bottles that say “with bleach” on the front label so you can use\nthem on colored materials and not have to worry about discoloration. Mold Off\nalso works well and helps prevent mildew for several months.\nHere are a few precautions to take when using mildew spray cleaners. Make\nsure to wear rubber gloves. The chemicals in these products are fairly strong and\nwill irritate your skin on contact. Also, try to work in a well-ventilated area. If you’re\ntreating mildew inside the flybridge enclosure, open some side panels to get a cross\nbreeze. If at any time you feel lightheaded or develop a headache, stop and take a\nbreak in fresh air. When you’re working on the underside of the canvas “ceiling,”\nsome mildew spray drips or mist may float down on you. Wear a face mask and\nsunglasses or safety goggles.\nThe only other items you’ll need are a soft hand brush, a scrub brush with a\nnarrow head (looks like a very large toothbrush), and a long pole with a soft deck\nbrush attached. If mildew is growing on the underside of the canvas top, the easiest\nway to remove it is to squirt the mildew spray cleaner on the head of the soft deck\nbrush attached to the long pole. (Wet the deck brush first so it can better absorb the\nmildew cleaner.) Run the wetted brush over the underside of the canvas, spray-\ning more mildew cleaner on the brush every few strokes, until all of the mildew\nis gone. You do not need to wipe it dry or do anything further. In fact, leaving a\nsmall amount of the mildew cleaner residue on the canvas will not discolor it and\nit will continue treating the mildew for several weeks without you having to do\nanything more.\nTreat mildew in canvas as soon as you notice it.\n\nCanvas, Carpet, Vinyl, and Plastic Windows 95\nThe seams and rolled edges of\nthe canvas often attract mildew faster\nbecause the material around the edges\nand zippers is thicker and doesn’t dry\nout as fast. Also, mildew often grows\nbetween the seams sewn in the plastic\naround the zippered areas. This mildew\ncan be impossible to remove if it’s not\ntreated on a regular basis because there\nis no way to clean that area with a brush\nor spray unless you take out the seam\nand restitch it. So, spray the mildew\ncleaner over the seams and let it soak in\nor slowly drip down into the seams. For\neasier-to-reach seams and rolled edges,\nspray the mildew cleaner over those areas and let it soak in for a few minutes. Then\ntake your small scrub brush and scrub these areas until you see the mildew loosen\nand dissolve. The mildew cleaner will do most of the work to eat away the mildew,\nbut it is up to you to remove it from the canvas when you’re finished. You can do that\nby cleaning the treated area with a damp rag or hosing it off.\nMildew that has formed on the exterior side of the canvas covers may require\nmore work. This mildew grew when the canvas was wet, but it has since dried on\nthe canvas from warm or dry weather. If the mildew looks more like moss, it will\nneed an even stronger treatment. Spray the mildew cleaner generously on all areas\nof the exterior canvas that show mildew growth. Then take your soft deck brush or\nhand brush and work the mildew cleaner into the canvas. Let it soak in for three to\nfive minutes. You may need to repeat this several times before you see any changes.\nAfter letting the cleaner soak in, use the soft deck brush to redistribute it all over\nthe canvas again. Then spray off the cleaner with a hose. To prevent mildew from\nquickly coming back in those areas, lightly spray more mildew cleaner over the\ncanvas but don’t scrub it in or hose it off. Leaving it there won’t do any damage and\nwill deter mildew growth.\nThese steps will be most successful on mildew that is green because green\nmildew is still somewhat “fresh” and new. If the mildew on your canvas is black\n(this can be difficult to tell on dark-colored canvas), it means that the mildew has\nbeen on the canvas for a long time, has dried into it, and has discolored the fabric.\nCleaning mildew out of canvas\n\n96 The Insider’s Guide to Boat Cleaning and Detailing\nYou can try treating the canvas with the steps above, but it may be more beneficial\nto take the canvas to a commercial cleaner.\nCleaning Dirty Canvas\nOver time, canvas that isn’t washed on a regular basis will get dirty, especially\nin areas where water runs over the canvas in the same place every time it rains,\nor where water pools on the canvas for long periods of time. Before using chemi-\ncal cleaners and a lot of elbow grease, remove the canvas (such as canvas covers\non vinyl seats or benches or canvas covers on ski boats) and put it in your home\nwasher and dryer or take it to a laundromat. Wash it in warm (not hot) water, and\nset the dryer to low heat to prevent shrinking the canvas. During the wash cycle,\nadd a small amount of waterproofing solution, which is available at camping\nstores. When drying, throw several dryer sheets in with the canvas covers. Dryer\nsheets that prevent static cling also help fabric resist water, so rainwater will bead\nup slightly on the canvas rather than soak into it.\nIf it’s not easy or convenient to remove the canvas covers and launder them\nin a washer and dryer, you can treat them on the boat with spray cleaners. A mix\nof bleach in a bucket of water wiped over the canvas with a soft brush will work\nwell, but make sure it’s color-safe bleach, even if you have white canvas. I have\nseen bleach, and cleaners with bleach in them, discolor white canvas, turning it a\ndull yellow. Krazy Clean (available at boat supply stores) is good at removing water\nstains from canvas, although a commercial cleaning product might be necessary\nfor water stains that have been there for a long time. If you’re going to use a spray\ncleaner, such as Krazy Clean, Lysol, or Tilex, directly on the canvas, spray it on the\nbrush and then wipe it on rather than spraying it directly on the canvas. This will\nhelp to prevent yellowing.\nIf your boat is moored in salt water or you take it out on salt water often, you\nknow how important it is to wash the salt from the windows and gelcoat on your\nboat. It’s just as important to scrub the canvas to remove all salt spray so it doesn’t\nget “burned” into the canvas and start breaking down the fabric over time.\nPlastic Windows\nThe material used for the plastic windows (also known as Strataglass or Isenglass)\non dodger or flybridge enclosures is a special type of vinyl called pressed polished\n\nCanvas, Carpet, Vinyl, and Plastic Windows 97\nsheets or pressed poly. The material is actually two layers of non-colored vinyl\nlaminated together under intense pressure and high heat. This process squeezes\nout all the impurities and renders the vinyl perfectly clear. Pressed poly is known\nby its gauge: 20 gauge is made from two 10-gauge pieces heated together; 40 gauge\nis made from two 20-gauge pieces heated together, and so on. Like all vinyl, clear\nvinyl contains plasticizers to keep it soft and pliable and UV stabilizers to retard\nUV degradation. Over time, if not cared for, clear vinyl can lose its plasticity and\nbecome brittle and yellowed, and eventually crack or become hazy and difficult to\nsee through. Additionally, the UV protection added in the manufacturing process\nbreaks down over time, leaving the vinyl with no more UV protection after only a\ncouple of years.\nThere are several ways to care for plastic windows from the moment you pur-\nchase them new to trying to bring them back if they are lightly scratched and hazy.\nThis section explains what items you’ll need to clean and protect plastic windows,\nalong with how to do it step-by-step.\nGear and Supplies\nThe one item you will need no matter what condition your plastic windows are in\nis microfiber towels. This is the only type of rag soft enough to not leave scratches.\nMake sure you remove any tags on the microfiber rag so they don’t scratch the\nclear vinyl. Also, keep the microfiber rags you use for plastic windows separate\nfrom the rags you use on other areas of the boat or your house. This will prevent\nthe residue from other cleaners not intended for clear vinyl to get on your plastic\nwindows.\nThe next item you will need is a cleaner spray. There are many good “plastic\nwindow” cleaner sprays on the market, but, to be safe, you should purchase one\nat an auto or boat supply store. You do not want to use a cleaner that contains\nchemicals that cause drying or hazing. Windex, although a good product for glass\nwindows, should never be used on clear vinyl windows. Some good cleaners spe-\ncifically for plastic windows are:\n \nMeguiar’s #17 Mirror Glaze Plastic Cleaner\n \nIMAR Strataglass Protective Cleaner\n \nPlexus Plastic Polish\n \nMer-maids Plastic Cleaner\n\n98 The Insider’s Guide to Boat Cleaning and Detailing\nIf your plastic windows are older and scratched, try removing the scratches\nbefore you apply the polish. In the same area of boat supply stores where you’ll\nfind plastic window cleaners, you’ll also find products that remove scratches in\nclear vinyl. The products I use most often for this task are 3M Finesse It Finishing\nMaterial or 3M Imperial Compound and Finishing Material. These are light com-\npounding agents that don’t contain wax. They are excellent for removing scratches\nand swirl marks and, although they are rubbing compounds, they won’t further\nscratch your plastic windows.\nThe last product you’ll want to have on hand is a polish or sealer. Your first\nstep (using a cleaner) removed dirt. The second step (using a light compounding\nagent) removed scratches. This final step is where you apply a polish that will help\nyour clear vinyl to resist scratching, maintain softness and flexibility, improve UV\nprotection, repel water, and create an antistatic finish. Some recommended pol-\nishes include:\n \nMeguiar’s #10 Mirror Glaze Clear Plastic Polish\n \nIMAR Strataglass Protective Polish\n \n303 Aerospace Protectant\nCleaning, Scratch Removal, and Polishing\nIf you have new plastic windows with no scratches, all you’ll need at this point is a\ncleaner spray and a polish. If there are light scratches in the plastic windows, use a\nscratch remover before polishing them, but you’ll still start with a cleaner as your\nfirst step. Spritz the cleaner spray all over the plastic windows and then wipe it off\nthe entire window with a microfiber rag. If the windows are very dirty or dusty, you\nmay want to repeat this step to get all of the dirt. It’s best to wipe down the win-\ndows two times lightly than one time hard to prevent possible scratching. If it’s a\nwarm day or you’re working in direct sunlight, do smaller sections so the product\ndoesn’t dry on the plastic before you can wipe it off.\nIf there are light scratches or hazing in your plastic windows, pour a quarter-\nsize dab of finishing compound on a microfiber rag. Rub it into a small section,\npreferably in a corner or less noticeable area of the window. Rub it until the liq-\nuid product starts to dry, then wipe it off with another microfiber rag. This should\nremove light scratches and minimize deeper scratches and hazing. If this step\nworked to remove the scratches or hazing, continue working the product into sec-\n\nCanvas, Carpet, Vinyl, and Plastic Windows 99\ntions of the plastic windows until you\nhave covered all areas. If it’s not work-\ning, it’s because the scratches are too\ndeep, the vinyl is too old, or the haz-\ning has already done too much damage\nand has been on the window for a long\ntime.\nAfter cleaning the plastic windows\nand trying to remove scratches and haz-\ning, you are now ready for the final step\nof polishing the clear vinyl to improve\nits resistance to dust, dirt, scratching,\nhazing, and water spots. Some polishes come in a spray bottle and some are a liq-\nuid paste that you apply as you would wax. Spray the polish on the plastic window\nor pour some onto a microfiber rag. Work it into the plastic, wiping it on evenly and\ncovering all areas. If you’ve wiped on a liquid paste polish, take a clean microfiber\nrag and lightly wipe it off. If you sprayed the polish on and wiped it off, you may\nwant to take another clean microfiber rag and go over the windows one more time\nwithout adding any polish to make sure you wiped off all of the residue.\nIt may be difficult to reach the outside of the plastic windows with a micro-\nfiber rag. I sometimes drape a rag over my deck brush to reach these areas. If you\nhave a very soft deck brush attachment for a long-handled pole, you can use it spar-\ningly to wash any hard-to-reach window panels as long as you use plenty of soap\nand water and rinse quickly and thoroughly to prevent the soap from drying and\nwater spots from forming.\nIf you clean and polish your plastic windows once every month or two, they\nwill continue to perform as they were intended—a clear protective window at the\nhelm station, pliable window panels that you can roll up to allow airflow through-\nout the flybridge, and an enclosure to keep the weather out while cruising or enjoy-\ning your boat at the slip.\nOutdoor Deck Carpeting\nOutdoor deck carpeting on your boat provides a more comfortable area to walk\non with bare feet and for little ones crawling around on the aft deck. It makes your\nboat feel more “homey” and gives it a finished look. The best places for deck car-\nUse only microfiber cloths to clean plastic windows.\n\n100 The Insider’s Guide to Boat Cleaning and Detailing\npet are on the aft deck (or sundeck), the stairs leading up to the flybridge, and the\ncockpit or flybridge itself. I don’t recommend putting carpet on the swim platform\nbecause it will always be wet and you’ll always have to scrub it to remove any mil-\ndew. When it’s wet, it can also be slippery, and that’s the last thing you want as\npeople board your boat.\nTypes of Outdoor Deck Carpeting\nThere are two main types of outdoor deck carpet—berber and pile. Berber looks\nlike small hooks or loops, and pile consists of very close-trimmed fibers much like\ncarpet you might see in an office. Outdoor carpet manufactured specifically for\nmarine use is produced from solution-dyed fibers enhanced with UV stabilizers to\nprotect the carpeting from salt water and extreme sun and moisture.\nOne very important factor about deck carpeting for your boat is that it must\nstay in place! You want carpet with a rubber backing, or you’ll want to install snaps\naround the edge of the deck and the carpet to snap the carpet into place. From\na cleaning perspective, snapping carpet is the smarter choice simply because if\nyou don’t take up the carpet occasionally to clean the deck underneath or put it\naway for the winter, over time the rubber backing can “melt” into the nonskid and\nmake a mess when you finally take up the carpet. The backing can also dry out and\nbecome brittle, so when you pull up the carpet, the dried-out rubber cracks into\nhundreds of small pieces, making a mess on your nonskid deck.\nOne type of carpeting not to use on a boat is throw rugs. They are not made\nfor harsh marine environments and will often bleed or shed on the nonskid when\nwet. If left in place for a long time, the nonskid will become discolored where the\nrugs were lying. And because they can move around easily, they’re not safe.\nIf you want to have throw rugs made for high-traffic areas to use when enter-\ntaining or while docked at the slip, request a few throw carpets to be made by the\ncompany that makes your deck carpet (or look in your local boating yellow pages\nfor a carpet company). Make sure the throw rugs are backed with rubber so they\nhave a good grip on top of your deck carpet, but put them away when they’re not in\nuse so they remain in good condition and the rubber backing doesn’t affect your\nmain deck carpeting.\nIf you are going to have work done to your boat, put away the deck carpets and\nbring out some rubber work mats or plastic sheeting (available at larger hardware\n\nCanvas, Carpet, Vinyl, and Plastic Windows 101\nand variety stores) to protect your nonskid carpets from grease, oil, nicks, and stains\nduring the work. This is especially important if workers will be in the engine room!\nIf friends will be on your boat, definitely put the carpeting down. Most non-\nboaters don’t always choose the best shoes to wear on a boat, and carpeting allows\nsomeone wearing heels, shoes with poor traction, or shoes with black marking soles\nto feel safe and comfortable walking around while still protecting your nonskid.\n(This assumes you actually have non-boater friends!) If you have teak decks, you\nmight put custom deck carpets down when you entertain. Unfortunately, there’s\nnot much you can do about your guests spilling their red wine or ketchup, except\nto keep the carpet cleaner nearby!\nGear and Supplies\nHere are a few items you’ll want to have on hand for cleaning carpet stains and\npreventing stains from soaking in.\n \nCarpet stain remover, such as Folex or Spot Off\n \nCarpet stain guard, such as 3M Scotchguard\n \nMildew spray cleaner, such as Lysol or Tilex\n \nHand scrub brushes\nKeeping Carpet Clean\nKeeping your outdoor deck carpet in good condition isn’t difficult as long as you’re\nproactive about keeping it clean and dry. If someone spills something on it, wipe it\nup as quickly as possible. Better yet, spray your carpets with a stain guard to pre-\nvent stains from soaking in. Keep a carpet cleaner spray and scrub brush nearby to\nget a stain out when it happens.\nPull your carpets up in the wet winter months and keep them in dry storage.\nThis will give them a much longer life than if you keep them on your boat year-\nround. Even if your carpeted sundeck is covered or enclosed, wet weather can cause\ndampness in an enclosed space (think of your sundeck like a greenhouse) and foster\nthe growth of mold and mildew. Additionally, if rain drains in such a way as to touch\nthe edge of the carpets at an entryway to your sundeck, for example, the carpet\nedges will rarely have a chance to dry out and will surely turn green with mildew.\n\n102 The Insider’s Guide to Boat Cleaning and Detailing\nWhat to do once your tan carpets have turned green? Buy a mildew spray\ncleaner and spray it on the carpets and scrub it in with a brush. You can then hose\noff that section, provided the carpet will get a chance to dry. If not, simply use a\nlittle less spray, but work it in well and\nleave it in the carpet. It will continue\nto treat the mildew and prevent it from\ncoming back.\nIf you left your boat carpets down\nall winter and they’re looking green\nand dingy, take advantage of the first\nwa rm days of spring or summer to\ngive them a thorough wash. Take them\noff the boat and lay them on the dock,\nthen spray them with a carpet cleaner\nor mildew spray cleaner (if needed) and\nscrub them with a light bristled brush.\nLet the cleaner sit for a while, scrub it\nagain, and then hose it off. Lay the carpets out to dry and then put them back on\nthe boat for the warmer months.\nIf your deck carpets are looking dingy and spot cleaning just won’t do the trick,\nor you don’t want to spend your free time cleaning your deck carpets, take them to\na carpet cleaning company to do the job for you. However, there will come a time\nwhen even the most professional carpet cleaner won’t be able to revive the softness\nand color that once existed—for example, on carpets left on the deck for the past\ntwelve winters. In that case, it might be time to get new deck carpeting. This is a\ngood time to switch from a rubber-backed carpet to a snap-on carpet, to choose a\nnew color, and to start keeping the carpeting as dry and clean as you can.\nMaintaining deck carpets is not the most exciting part of owning a boat, but\nboats with clean, dry deck carpets look inviting, and carpets are an easy, inexpen-\nsive way to give an older boat a new look.\nInterior Carpet\nThe best way to keep interior carpets clean is to use runners that are easy to remove\nand clean. Buying throw rugs or runners with a rubber backing at a variety or car-\npet store is a good solution, but a better solution is to have canvas runners cut to\nLeave the mildew spray cleaner in the carpet so it will\nkeep working.\n\nCanvas, Carpet, Vinyl, and Plastic Windows 103\nmatch the layout of your boat’s interior and install snaps or hooks to attach them to\nthe carpet and keep them in place. This type of runner will do a better job of keep-\ning stains from touching any part of the carpet because the runners will have been\nmeasured to fit your interior’s carpeted area and therefore will cover almost every\ninch of it. There won’t be any sections that aren’t protected, as in the case with two\nrunners that don’t match up perfectly. And the installed canvas carpet covers will\nstay in place better.\nIf you choose to install canvas carpet covers, have them treated with a stain\nguard before they are brought on board. Also, request that the sewn-in loops that\nwill connect to the hooks in the cabin carpet are slightly elastic. Over time, these\ncarpet runners shrink when cleaned and dried, and it can be very difficult to reat-\ntach them to the hooks in the cabin carpet.\nTo clean canvas carpet covers, simply remove them from the boat and wash\nand dry them at home or in a laundromat as you would the canvas covers used on\nthe exterior of the boat. Use the warm-water setting on the washer and the low heat\nsetting on the dryer. Or have a professional cleaning service clean and dry them\nfor you.\nIf you don’t use this type of interior carpet protection, the best way to keep\nyour carpets clean is to remove stains as quickly as possible to keep them from set-\nting in and to have your carpets professionally cleaned at the end of each boating\nseason. You can use a store-bought carpet cleaner spray, but sometimes making\nyour own from natural products, either on their own or used with a store-bought\ncleaner, will do a better job of removing stains and will certainly be less expensive.\nA commercial carpet cleaner in my area (D. A. Burns, in Seattle) provided me with\nthe following list of cleaning solutions to use on specific carpet stains. For each\nstain listed, one or more of these solutions may be required, together with some\nwhite absorbent towels or rags, to remove most or all of the stain.\nCleaning Solutions (Ingredients or Products)\n \nDetergent solution. Carpet cleaner like Spot Off or Folex, or mix your own:\n1 teaspoon clear, mild liquid dishwashing detergent and 1 cup lukewarm\nwater.\n \nAmmonia solution.

Test the solution on a small, inconspicuous area, then tackle the stain\nby working from the outer edge towards the center; blot, don’t rub.\n2. The final spot-removal step is always to gently rinse the area with water,\nthen soak up all the remaining moisture with absorbent towels.\n3. When finished, place a half-inch pad of white absorbent paper towels\nover the affected area and weight it down with a flat, heavy object.\n4.

Vinyl is\nsmooth and therefore easy to clean with a multipurpose spray cleaner, but because\nvinyl is technically a fabric, it can absorb water and, if not allowed to dry out, can\nfoster the growth of mildew. Left untreated, the mildew is difficult to remove. If you\ndon’t plan on treating the mildew in your vinyl cushions, simply buy pink cushions\nto begin with and you won’t even notice the mildew. That’s because mildew that’s\nbeen left on vinyl for a long time will eventually turn the vinyl pink. But more on\nthis later.\nGear and Supplies\nThe following items will help remove stains and prevent stains or other elements\n(UV rays, salt water) from causing additional wear and tear.\n \nMr. Clean Magic Eraser cleaning pads\n \nMildew spray cleaner, such as Lysol or Tilex\n \nMultipurpose cleaner, such as Inf latable Boat Cleaner, Black Streak\nRemover, or Krazy Clean (all are available at boat supply stores)\n \n303 Aerospace Protectant\n \nMicrofiber rags\nRemoving Bird and Spider Stains\nBird droppings are acidic and high in nitrogen in the form of ammonia, a molecule\nformed from nitrogen and hydrogen. When the droppings dry out, the product\nproduced is a salt—a chemical compound that forms when a base, in this case\nammonia, reacts with an acid. Over time, the salt causes metal to rust and gelcoat\nor fabric to become etched or develop pinholes. This alone is an excellent reason\n\n106 The Insider’s Guide to Boat Cleaning and Detailing\nto wax your boat so the bird droppings sit on top of the wax. Likewise, it’s an excel-\nlent reason to clean the vinyl seating on your boat to keep the vinyl from breaking\ndown over time.\nIf birds use your exterior vinyl seats for target practice and spiders use your\ninterior vinyl seats as their own personal restroom (spider droppings look like small\nblack dots), your vinyl probably needs to be restored to its white state, then heavily\nprotected to prevent future stains. Once these stains have had a chance to “soak”\ninto vinyl, they can be difficult to remove with just a spray cleaner and a rag.\nYou’ll want to purchase two items for this task. The first is a Mr. Clean Magic\nEraser pad (Extra Power), which you can buy at most grocery or variety stores. Buy\nthe ones that are white, not blue and white, because it’s the white side that you’ll be\nusing on the vinyl. The other product you’ll need is either Inflatable Boat Cleaner\nor Black Streak Remover, available at boating supply stores. Once you have these\nitems, along with rubber gloves and a microfiber rag, you are ready to begin.\nSpray the cleaner (Inflatable Boat Cleaner or Black Streak Remover) over the\nvinyl, then take the magic pad and lightly wipe it over the areas you’ve sprayed. If\nthere is a stain (ink, bird, or spider droppings, drink stains, et cetera), use a light\namount of pressure over that particular area. This should remove all stains and\n“graying” from dirt and grime and make your vinyl white again.\nOnce you’ve used the magic pad to clean the vinyl, it’s now time to protect it\nagain since the magic pads contain a light abrasive agent and will have removed\nany protectant you originally had on them. Spray on the 303 Aerospace Protectant\nand wipe it in with a microfiber rag. Your white vinyl seats and cushions should\nVinyl with water stains The Magic Eraser pad is excellent for cleaning vinyl.\n\nCanvas, Carpet, Vinyl, and Plastic Windows 107\nshine again like new, and future stains will sit on top of the protectant and be eas-\nier to clean off rather than soaking into the vinyl fabric over time.\nRemoving Mildew\nAnd now back to that pink vinyl. There are ways to prevent this from ever happen-\ning to your vinyl, and it all relates to keeping your exterior seat cushions dry. If they\nare removable, bring them inside the boat or your garage for dry storage through\nthe wet months. If they are not removable, protect them with a canvas or plastic\ncover. Make sure there is a small amount of breathing space so air can get through\nor under the cover; otherwise, the cushions won’t dry out if they get damp or moist\nfrom windy and rainy weather.\nIf there is mildew on your vinyl, whether it is black or green, spray one side of\nthe cushion with mildew spray and use a soft hand brush or light scrub brush to\nwork the mildew out of the vinyl “grain.” The scrub brush is ideal for getting mil-\ndew out of rolled edges and seams. Either hose off or wipe off the mildew cleaner\nand let that surface dry. Turn the cushion over and spritz it with mildew cleaner\nspray as well. You can wipe it off with a rag or just let it soak in to prevent future\nmildew growth. When finished, let the cushions dry completely. Then use the 303\nAerospace Protectant to further protect the vinyl from UV rays and stains.\nThe best way to prevent stains on your vinyl seats and cushions is to protect\nthe vinyl material. Conditioner won’t soak in to vinyl the way it soaks in to leather.\nBut you can keep vinyl from drying out or breaking down over time from con-\nstant contact with UV rays. A product called 303 Aerospace Protectant, available at\nboating supply stores, is similar to ArmorAll, used on car interiors, but is made for\nmarine conditions and contains slightly stronger UV protectants. Spray the pro-\ntectant over the vinyl, being sure to cover all sides and edges, and rub it in with a\nmicrofiber rag. This will make your vinyl seats shine, protect them from UV rays,\nand make them more stain resistant. Spray them with this product once a month\nto keep them in good condition.\nInterior Fabrics\nWhen shopping for interior fabrics such as curtains, bedding, towels, and throw\nrugs or carpet runners, make sure they are easy to attach and reconnect (curtains)\n\n108 The Insider’s Guide to Boat Cleaning and Detailing\nand can be easily removed (duvet covers or carpet runners) so you can wash and\ndry them as needed.\nCurtains can be vacuumed in between washes to remove dust. Duvet covers\nare better than comforters because they’re easier to remove, wash, and dry. Throw\nrugs and carpet runners can easily be vacuumed or taken up and washed at home\nor by a rug cleaning service. If you don’t use your boat during cold, wet, or winter\nmonths, you should remove as many of these interior fabrics as you can, wash and\ndry them, and store them in a dry place until spring.\nFabric seat cushion covers should be removed and run through a washer and\ndryer. If the covers aren’t removable but the cushions aren’t very large or thick, you\ncan put the entire cushion in a washer and dryer. Otherwise, you can take them to\na commercial fabric cleaner, who can also treat the cushions with a stain guard to\nprevent future stains from soaking in as easily.\nIf you have vinyl headboards or wall panels, take a multipurpose cleaner and\na Mr. Clean magic pad, spray the stain with the cleaner, and lightly wipe the stain\naway with the magic pad.\n\n109\nC h A p t e r\nNatural Cleaning\nProducts\nAs recreational boaters, we enjoy watching nature take place around us, whether\nwe’re simply sitting on our boat in its slip at the marina or cruising on fresh or\nsalt water. I always enjoy watching blue herons stealthily hunt for fish or seals and\notters stick their heads out of the water to see what’s going on in our world.\nI often wonder just how clean our waterways are for these creatures—the\nmammals, the water fowl, and the fish—and what we can do to prevent adding\nmore pollution to their environment. This chapter covers:\n \nDefining “biodegradable”\n \nAnd the award for “best cleaner” goes to . . .\n \nCleaning with baking soda, vinegar, and hydrogen peroxide\n \nOther useful household cleaners\n \nHandy quick guide to natural cleaning products\nBut the Boat Soap Says\nBiodegradable . . .\nMost of the boat cleaning and washing products you’ll find at boating supply\nstores are marked “biodegradable.” This simply means that these products can\nbe decomposed by biological agents in the water, such as bacteria. A biodegrad-\n7\n\n110 The Insider’s Guide to Boat Cleaning and Detailing\nable product like boat soap eventually “breaks down” in the water, as opposed to\nremaining in its current form, such as oil. However, biodegradable products can\nstill kill or sicken waterfowl and fish. This is because most soaps and other clean-\ning agents contain phosphates.\nPhosphates encourage plant growth by enabling plant leaves to make food.\nWhile small amounts of phosphates are good for the environment, large amounts\nare harmful. Phosphates biodegrade slowly and their effects are felt for a long time.\nPhosphates increase the acidity of the water and speed up the growth of algae,\nwhich blocks light and chokes water flow, making it difficult for other living organ-\nisms (plants and fish) to exist in that environment. In essence, phosphates slowly\nsuffocate the creatures living in that area. Algae rob other plants of the nourish-\nment they need to survive, and decaying plant material uses up the available oxy-\ngen in the water when these plants die.\nWhen you purchase boat soap or any type of surfactant (a surface activat-\ning agent), make sure it contains little or no phosphates. Any boat soap or cleaner\nthat does not contain phosphates will most likely tout that on the label, so it will\nbe easy to find the phosphate-free cleaners among all the others. One type of soap\nthat should never be used to wash your boat is liquid dish soap. Although many\nbrands are biodegradable, they are high in phosphates, which is what produces\nall of the suds that we associate with a “hardworking” soap. The biodegradable or\nlow-phosphate soaps that you’ll find at boat supply stores will still do a good job\nof getting your boat clean while having less negative impact on local waterways.\nLiquid dish soap is also fairly drying and can strip wax over time.\nAnd the Award for Best Cleaner\nGoes To . . .\nWax. The liquid and paste waxes available at boating supply stores aren’t neces-\nsarily considered natural products (although brands like Zymol and waxes that are\nmade mostly of carnauba are more natural), but wax is one of the best “cleaners”\nyou can use on your boat for the sole reason that it stays on the boat! It doesn’t get\nwashed or rinsed off only to end up in the water, yet it’s a very versatile cleaner.\n(Yes, wax dust ends up in the air when you buff it off the boat, but those small par-\nticles are spread over a greater area and become more “diluted” than the amount\nof boat soap that is washed into the water.)\n\nNatural Cleaning Products 111\nSome good uses for wax as a cleaner include:\n \nClea n i ng water sta i ns f rom\ngelcoat\n \nP o l i s h i n g a n d p r o t e c t i n g\nchrome rails\n \nRemoving rust from stainless\nand other metals\n \nRemov ing shoe scuf f ma rks\nfrom gelcoat\n \nRemoving stains left on gelcoat\nfrom bird and spider droppings\n \nRemov ing water spots f rom\nexterior windows\n \nRemoving marks made by lines\nrubbing across gelcoat\nLook for a cleaner wax (liquid as\nopposed to paste, such as Meguiar’s Cleaner Wax or SeaPower) because it contains\na light-grade rubbing compound and will remove more types of marks and stains\nthan a soft wax that contains no rubbing compound.\nIf It’s Good for Cookies . . .\nA few ingredients in your kitchen or galley also work well as cleaning products\nor as a component of natural cleaning products. These ingredients are much less\nexpensive than chemical cleaners, are healthier for your respiratory system and\nthe environment, and help save room in boat storage compartments. Keep one\nlarge box of baking soda and a bottle of vinegar in a cupboard instead of several\nspray bottles of chemical cleaners.\nBaking Soda\nBaking soda is one of the most widely used natural cleaning products available.\nBaking soda (or bicarbonate of soda, as it is also known) is a naturally occurring\nmaterial, present in most organic life forms. It can be “made” from sodium car-\nUse cleaner wax to remove scuff marks and other marks\nin gelcoat.\n\n112 The Insider’s Guide to Boat Cleaning and Detailing\nbonate, or soda ash. When soda ash is dissolved in a carbon-dioxide-rich solution,\nsodium bicarbonate (baking soda) precipitates out. It’s versatile and inexpensive,\nhas no toxic scent or ingredients, can be used as a dry powder or liquid paste, and\ncan be found at all grocery and household variety stores. To make a paste from\nbaking soda, simply mix it with water until you have the desired thickness for its\npurpose. Here are a few ways to use baking soda on your boat:\n \nScrub dirt out of the nonskid “pockets”\n \nSoak up oil or grease stains on the nonskid and teak decks (powder form)\n \nPolish stainless steel\n \nRemove rust on metal deck hardware\n \nClean stains on vinyl (paste form)\n \nFreshen fridges, freezers, cupboards, and heads (powder form)\n \nRemove tarnish from silver that has been in contact with aluminum foil\n(powder dissolved in warm water)\n \nPut out small fires (powder form)\nDon’t use baking soda, either in powder\nor paste form, to remove stains from smooth\ngelcoat. Baking soda acts as a light abrasive\nand it will remove not only the stain but the\nwax on your gelcoat. If you do use baking soda\nto remove a stain on smooth gelcoat, follow it\nup with wax in that area. (Or just use cleaner\nwax to remove the stain and you won’t have\nto follow up with anything.) Also, do not use\nbaking soda to clean aluminum objects; it\nattacks the thin nonreactive protective oxide\nlayer of this otherwise very reactive metal.\nVinegar\nWhite household vinegar is a weak form of acetic acid that forms through the\nfermentation of sugars or starches. It is completely edible and cannot harm your\nstomach. And luckily for us, it can be used to clean many things. Although it has a\npungent odor, vinegar has so many uses that you should have at least a few bottles\nA more natural way to clean nonskid\n\nNatural Cleaning Products 113\nof it on your boat at all times. Try some of these tips with vinegar and a few other\nnatural household ingredients:\n \nFor spills on carpet, use a sponge or cloth to soak up as much liquid as\npossible. Then spray the area with a mixture of half vinegar, half water.\nLet stand for about two minutes, then blot with a towel or sponge. Repeat\nas needed. For more persistent stains, use a mixture of 1 teaspoon vinegar,\n1 teaspoon liquid dish soap, and 1 cup warm water. Proceed as suggested\nabove. Then dry the spot with a hair dryer set on low.\n \nTo clean windows, spray with half vinegar, half water. Wipe clean with\nnewspapers or a cloth.\n \nTo clean silver, pewter, copper, or brass, dissolve 1 teaspoon salt in 1 cup\nvinegar. Add flour to make a paste (you should have ¼ cup or more). Apply\nthe paste to the metal item, and let stand for at least 15 minutes. Rinse with\nwarm water and polish with a soft cloth.\n \nTo clean wood paneling, use a mixture of 1/2 cup olive oil, 1/2 cup vinegar,\nand 2 cups warm water. Apply to paneling with a soft cloth. Dry with a\nclean cloth.\n \nTo remove corrosion or chemical buildup from showerheads, soak in vin-\negar overnight.\n \nRemove stains from a toilet bowl by spraying with vinegar. To remove cal-\ncium scale inside marine toilets and discharge hoses, which can cause\nthe toilet to get progressively harder to flush and eventually lead to total\nblockage, pour 1 pint (2 cups) white vinegar into the bowl once a month\nand pump it slowly (a single stroke every four to five minutes) through the\ntoilet. The mildly acidic vinegar dissolves fresh scale deposits.\n \nTo remove soap buildup from faucets, clean with a mixture of one part salt\nto four parts vinegar.\n \nSpray shower walls and shower curtains with mixture of vinegar and water\nto help prevent mildew.\n \nTo clean wooden cutting boards, wipe with vinegar.\n \nPolish tarnished brass with 1 tablespoon each f lour, salt, and vinegar.\nApply the paste with a clean, damp rag, and rub off the tarnish. Wipe off\nthe residue with a dry rag.\n \nRemove hard water stains by spraying them with vinegar (simply pour\nsome into a spray bottle) and rinse with fresh water.\n\n114 The Insider’s Guide to Boat Cleaning and Detailing\nCleaning with Peroxide\nHydrogen peroxide is odorless and colorless, but not tasteless. Cleaning with\nhydrogen peroxide—also referred to as H \n2 \nO \n2 \n—is one of the easiest ways to make\nsure that you provide a safer, cleaner space, with lower bacteria levels, but with-\nout the risk of the toxicity that is sometimes associated with commercial chemical\nspray cleaners.\n \nClean appliances, countertops, and the inside of the refrigerator with\nhydrogen peroxide. It not only cleans and shines everything, it kills germs.\nWhile you’re at it, pour a drop of peroxide right onto your cutting board to\ndestroy bacteria, like salmonella.\n \nMake your dishes sparkle and disinfect the dishwasher at the same time.\nPour a capful of peroxide in the pre-wash compartment, fill the compart-\nment with dishwashing detergent, and run the cycle. While that’s clean-\ning, give your plants a lift by adding 1 tablespoon peroxide to their water.\n \nForget harsh chemicals like bleach to brighten your whites. Add a capful\n(no more) of peroxide to your washer along with your soap. Don’t overdo it,\nthough, because peroxide is acidic and could harm delicate fabric.\n \nKeep a spray bottle of peroxide in the bathroom. Mix a solution of 50 per-\ncent peroxide to 50 percent water. Spray down the shower when you’re fin-\nished bathing to prevent mold and mildew from forming.\n \nPour 1 cup hydrogen peroxide in the toilet and let it sit overnight. Scrub the\ntoilet in the morning, and the bowl will be super clean.\n \nRemove bloodstains from clothing, upholstery, and carpet with peroxide.\nPour a dab directly on the spot and let it soak for one minute. Promptly\nrinse with warm water and blot dry with a clean cloth. Repeat as necessary.\nThe peroxide works as an oxidizer to lift stains.\nOther Useful Household Cleaners\nIf you need a light abrasive cleaner or paste cleaner to use on specific areas of the\nboat, mix baking soda, salt, sugar, or cornstarch with water. Use a sliced lemon\ndipped in salt to clean brass, then wipe it off with a clean, dry rag. Remove new rust\nstains on fiberglass with a mixture of cola and salt, then rinse with clean water.\n\nNatural Cleaning Products 115\nRemember, ammonia can etch aluminum and make Plexiglas or Lexan look\ncloudy. When using it, avoid letting it touch those materials, and rinse the area\nwhere you’re working with fresh water often.\nAlternatives to Mildew-Cleaning Spray\nThese products can contain bleach; sodium hypochlorite, a bleaching and disin-\nfecting agent that is corrosive and can burn the skin and eyes; and formaldehyde,\na highly toxic chemical and known carcinogen. For mold and mildew removal, mix\n2 teaspoons tea tree oil (available at health food stores) in 2 cups water and keep in\na spray bottle. Spray onto mold or mildew. Don’t rinse. The strong smell fades in a\ncouple of days. This solution also removes musty odors from fabrics such as cush-\nions and curtains. Spray the fabric thoroughly so that it’s wet, then let it air-dry for\na few days until the fragrance of the tea tree oil subsides. For mold and mildew on\nnon-porous washable surfaces, try vinegar or a solution of borax and water.\nIf You Need Something Stronger than\nBaking Ingredients . . .\nIf you have a stain that won’t go away after trying the more natural products, use a\nstronger chemical cleaning product (like what you would buy in the cleaning aisle\nof a supermarket). But instead of hosing\nthe product off the boat, take an absor-\nbent rag and wipe it off or soak it up.\nExamples of “stronger” cleaning prod-\nucts are Lysol Mildew Remover, Black\nStreak Remover, adhesive remover, and\ncleaners that contain mostly chemicals,\nacids, or bleach. Read the back of the\nbottle to see what the product contains.\nRemember, just because it says “biode-\ngradable” doesn’t mean it is good for\nwaterways. It can still kill wildlife and\nplant life. \nWiping away a chemical cleaner prevents it from\ncontaminating our waterways.\n\n116 The Insider’s Guide to Boat Cleaning and Detailing\nHandy Quick Guide to Natural Cleaning Products\nStain or Use Solution—Main Ingredient\nBlood and other proteins Peroxide\nBoat soap Vinegar\nBrass Vinegar and salt\nCarpet stains Vinegar\nClothes—brighten in wash Peroxide\nCopper Vinegar and salt\nDeodorizer Baking soda\nDishes, dishwasher Peroxide\nDisinfectant Peroxide\nGerm killer Peroxide\nGrease stains Baking soda\nHard-water stains Vinegar\nMetal corrosion Vinegar\nMildew prevention Vinegar or peroxide\nPewter Vinegar and salt\nRoom odors Vinegar\nRust on metal Cleaner wax or baking soda\nScuff marks on gelcoat Cleaner wax\nSilver Vinegar and salt\nSoap buildup Vinegar\nTarnish on silver Baking soda\nToilet bowl stains Vinegar\nWater stains, streaks, and spots Cleaner wax\nWindows (glass only) Vinegar\nWine stains Peroxide\nWood cutting board Vinegar or peroxide\nWood paneling Vinegar\n\n117\nC h A p t e r\nCleaning While\nCruising\nSummer has arrived and you’re taking your family on a three-week cruise up and\ndown the coast or maybe to some islands nearby. You’ve stocked the boat with\neveryone’s favorite food and beverages, fun movies to watch in the evenings, and\nthe new electronics you bought yourself last Christmas, finally having a chance to\nuse them all. But did you remember to pack a boat cleaning kit with the items you’ll\nneed along the way to keep your boat clean and protected from the elements? It\ntakes just a few minutes while you’re under way or once you’ve docked to keep your\nboat clean in all the right places so it doesn’t become too big a chore once you’re\nback at your home slip.\nThis chapter discusses:\n \nThe importance of cleaning while cruising\n \nExterior cleaning—gear, supplies, and techniques\n \nInterior cleaning—gear, supplies, and techniques\nThe Importance of Cleaning While Cruising\nWhen you’re out cruising on salt water, your boat is getting hit with all of the ele-\nments that can be thrown at it, and often all at once. Water, salt, UV rays, dirt par-\nticles in the air, pollution (in the form of dirty or acid rain), bird droppings, and\nmaybe even fish blood (if you’re so lucky). Consider that if you’re on a two- to three-\n8\n\n118 The Insider’s Guide to Boat Cleaning and Detailing\nweek cruise, your boat will be exposed to these elements every day and, if they’re\nnot properly removed, they will wreak havoc on your gelcoat and windows to the\npoint that the gelcoat will start looking faded and window cleaner will no longer\nget your windows clean and free of water spots.\nConsider also that as you and your family spend more time on your boat, every\ntime you brush up against the side of the house structure or roll up a plastic win-\ndow panel, you’re causing the dirt and salt particles to lightly scratch those areas.\nSalt spray does the most damage to finishes and materials on a boat. Imagine that\nyou’ve just pulled into port and secured your boat in its slip. There is a light film of\nsalt spray all over your boat—on the hull, the decks and abovedeck structures and\nthe windows, and even in the nonskid. The sun’s rays shining through each droplet\nof salt as if it were a small mirror will cause the salt to burn or etch whatever it’s\nsitting on. You’ll see the damage of salt spray on darker-colored materials quite\neasily—for example, on a dark-colored hull or tinted windows. The damage done\nby salt spray still occurs on light-colored materials or clear windows, and although\nit won’t be as obvious, it still needs to be removed.\nIf you’ve been cruising on fresh water, you won’t have to worry about salt spray\non your boat, but the dirt particles in the air and other types of stains and marks\nwill still affect the cosmetic appearance and protective nature of the gelcoat. Once\nyou’ve arrived in your slip, you’ll probably want to head out and go sightseeing or\njoin up with your friends, but take a few minutes to clean your boat so that none of\nthe elements that landed on it do any actual damage. You’ll have less of a headache\nlater and hopefully be able to prevent salt spray or water spots from becoming per-\nmanent additions to your glass and plastic windows.\nExterior Cleaning\nYou probably already have most of what you’ll need to clean your boat stored in\na lazarette. The most obvious items are a hose, nozzle, boat soap, and a soft deck\nbrush. Make sure you also have the following:\n \nLarge pack of microfiber rags\n \nSqueegee, preferably a California Water Blade\n \nMr. Clean magic pads\n \nCleaner wax like Meguiar’s or SeaPower\n\nCleaning While Cruising 119\n \nSof t ha nd br u sh a nd sma l l\nscrub brush\n \nPlast ic w indow clea ner li ke\nMer-maids Plastic Cleaner or\nMeg u ia r’s #17 Mi r ror Gla ze\nPlastic Cleaner\nYou cannot just hose down your\nboat and call it good, unfortunately.\nSalt cannot be hosed off because all\nyou’ve done is simply hosed off the salt\ncrystal. There will still be salt residue\non your gelcoat or windows, and the\nonly way to remove that is to wash it off\nwith soap and a soft brush. If your boat\nhas been recently waxed or still has a\ngood coat of wax on it, the salt will be\neasier to wash off, and this chore will go\nmuch faster because it will take only one pass with the soft deck brush and some\nsoap and water to remove it.\nKeep all of your washing gear together where it is quickly and easily acces-\nsible so that once you’ve docked, you can grab it from one place and get to work.\nIf you have a mate to help you, one of you can operate the hose and one can work\nthe deck brush. Spray the boat thoroughly to remove most of the salt crystals, bird\ndroppings, and sand or dirt that has been tracked on the boat, then follow up with\nthe soft deck brush and soapy water. Work from the top down so everything drains\ndown and off.\nIf you’ve tracked sand on the boat, spend a few extra minutes hosing it off the\nboat (as well as hosing off the two- and four-legged creatures that brought it on the\nboat). Sand is an abrasive that can scratch gelcoat. It can also slowly clog drains, so\nspray the hose in all of your drains to make sure they’re not clogged.\nWhen you are finished washing the boat, squeegee as many areas as you\ncan to prevent any water spotting, especially if the boat is sitting in direct sun-\nlight. Squeegee the windows as well, because that will help you prepare for the\nnext step.\nThe best arsenal to have on a trip\nTip: The best squeegee I’ve found for quickly and\neasily drying a whole boat is the California Water\nBlade. Buy the larger rectangular one, not angled\non the edges, because it’s more flexible and works\nbetter on larger surfaces.\n\n120 The Insider’s Guide to Boat Cleaning and Detailing\nIf you’ve been cruising on salt water, spend the majority of your time get-\nting the windows (whether glass, Lexan, or plastic) completely clean. You’ll want\nto make sure you’ve removed all the salt crystals from them so they don’t leave\npermanent spots. Even if you’ve washed down the windows with soap and water\nwhen you washed the boat, they may still have a salt residue. Take a good look at\nthem after rinsing them several times to make sure they are salt-free.\nIf they’re not, grab some plastic window cleaner (even for the glass windows)\nand several clean, dry microfiber rags. Spray the plastic window cleaner generously\non each window, then wipe it down with a microfiber rag. On your second pass,\nspray the window again but with only a few light squirts of window cleaner. Take\nanother microfiber rag (not the one you just used because it now has salt residue on\nit and will only put the salt back on the window you’re trying to clean) and wipe the\nwindow again. Now look at the window from all angles. Your dock neighbors will\nthink you’re either obsessed or blind, but this is the only way to completely remove\nall of the salt residue from the windows. If left on, the residue will cause permanent\nspotting on the windows, which will no longer come off with just a spray cleaner\nand rag.\nNaturally, if you’ve been cruising with friends or family for long periods of\ntime, there are bound to be stains and marks on the gelcoat and nonskid. The\nbest way to quickly clean nonskid is\nto wipe it with a dampened Mr. Clean\nMagic pad. For grease stains, you can\nspritz them with a degreaser cleaner\nspray, wipe the magic pad over that sec-\ntion, then wipe it with a rag. To remove\nscuff marks or other stains and marks\nfrom smooth gelcoat, use a microfiber\nrag to apply a small amount of cleaner\nwax to the area. Let it dry to a haze and\nthen wipe off. Cleaner wax is an excel-\nlent “cleaner” to use all over your boat\nbecause it quickly and easily removes\nsta i ns or ma rk s on most su r faces,\nincluding plastics, glass, and stainless\nsteel and other metals.\nUse a Magic Eraser pad to remove black marks from\nnonskid.\n\nCleaning While Cruising 121\nInterior Cleaning\nThe four main items you should have on hand for quick interior cleaning are:\n \nVacuum that is easy to store and quick and easy to use\n \nMicrofiber rags\n \nMultipurpose spray cleaner\n \nTub of disinfecting wipes like Clorox Disinfecting Wipes\n \nCarpet spot remover like Folex\nOnce a day, vacuum all surfaces to remove crumbs on cushions or counters,\nfloor dirt, hair in the shower or around the toilet, and dog hair. Keeping on top of\nvacuuming crumbs and dirt as you go along will make a huge difference in how\nlong it takes to do a final cleaning once you’re back from your cruise. And daily vac-\nuuming should keep you from swimming in dog hair. If you have berber or short-\npile carpets and the vacuum doesn’t remove most of the dog hair, try lifting it with\na wide strip of tape (painter’s tape or packing tape). This is one of the best ways to\nthoroughly remove dog hair from carpet. Or . . . brown dog? Buy brown runners.\nIt’s best to choose a multipurpose spray cleaner that can be used on all sur-\nfaces, like mirrors, granite, veneer, stainless, or plastic. I prefer SprayWay because\nI’ve never found it to streak or leave a haze on any surface. You can find this prod-\nuct in the window cleaning section of grocery or variety stores. Keeping a product\nlike this on board allows you to quickly spray and wipe any surface without having\nto store several different cleaning products or carry around several products as\nyou go about the boat wiping down surfaces.\nDisinfecting wipes are useful for cleaning the toilet and surrounding areas, as\nwell as kitchen counters and handles that are often touched by everyone. They’re\na good way to keep heavily used areas clean and germ-free.\nRemove stains on carpets as quickly as you can with a carpet spot remover\nand a small scrub brush or even an old toothbrush. This will keep the stains from\npermanently setting in. After cleaning these spots, put down an old washcloth or\npaper towels to soak up any excess cleaner so the spots dry faster and people or\npets don’t walk on them while they’re drying.\nIn fact, you may want to purchase carpet runners just for the trip you’re plan-\nning to take. These will greatly improve the chances that you won’t come back with\nbadly stained carpeting that requires the services of a professional carpet cleaner.\n\n122 The Insider’s Guide to Boat Cleaning and Detailing\nWhen your your trip is over, the runners can easily be cleaned and stored for your\nnext cruise.\nSpot cleaning while cruising is the best way to keep on top of stains, marks,\nand spots that, if left alone, could create a lot more work for you when you return\nfrom your cruise. Water spots that are left to sit on windows eventually etch into\nthe glass or plastic and will be much more difficult to remove in the future, if you’re\nable to remove them at all. If you’re cruising with friends and family, assign every-\none on board a task for them to take care of. Make sure each activity above gets\ndone once each day. Unfortunately, until someone comes up with microfiber dog\nslippers and tail swishers, your four-legged skipper, who probably makes the big-\ngest mess of all, won’t be able to join in and ease your cleaning load.\n\n123\nC h A p t e r\nHiring a Detailer\nWashing, waxing, and detailing your boat can be a big job, whether your boat is\n30 feet or 60 feet long. Aside from taking a lot of time to keep your boat in good\ncondition, it also takes energy, flexibility, balance, skill, and physical exertion. If\nyou don’t have the time and/or physical ability to do it all yourself, consider hiring\na boat cleaner/detailer to do the work for you, especially if it means that the work\nwon’t get done otherwise.\nTaking care of light maintenance issues now, no matter who does the work,\ncan save a lot of headaches later. If, every time you set foot on your boat, washing\nor cleaning it takes away from the time you actually spend using and enjoying your\nboat, hiring a detailer can be liberating. Imagine being able to dock your boat on\na Sunday evening after a weekend of cruising and head straight home instead of\nspending an hour or two washing down the boat and vacuuming the potato chip\ncrumbs off the carpet. When you’ve had too much wine, and “red, right, return”\nhas tapped out your mental abilities, it’s a lot easier to dial your detailer than do\nthe cleaning yourself.\nHere are some tips on how to find and hire a good detailer and what you can\nexpect them to do. This chapter includes information on:\n \nWhere to find a detailer and what to look for\n \nCost of hiring a detailer\n \nWorking with a detailer\n \nWhat to do if the detailer missed something\n9\n\n124 The Insider’s Guide to Boat Cleaning and Detailing\nWhere to Find a Detailer and\nWhat to Look For\nYou’ll recognize good detailers when you see them, bundled up in their winter rain\ngear, washing boats in 35-degree weather while dealing with frozen hoses and\nrunny noses. These are not the fair-weathered detailers who swoop in from June to\nSeptember to see what work they can drum up for the summer, but rather the year-\nround, dedicated detailers who have\nmost likely been at it for a long time and\nare still at it (even in winter) because\nthey love their work.\nThe best way to find a good detailer\nis to ask around. Who does your dock\nneighbor use? Who stops in at the boat\nsupply store on a regular basis to buy\nmore products? Who do the marinas\nrecommend? Who does the brokerage\nyou bought your boat from use? Here\nare a few things that any good detailer\nwill have, use, or do.\n \nThey will have insurance and a business license.\n \nThey will use products made for gelcoat and boats rather than household\nor auto products (except where the latter are appropriate).\n \nThey will not use harsh chemicals or cleaners on their first pass, but will\nuse them only as a last resort and will be careful about disposing of them.\n \nThey will have references you can check.\n \nThey will call you if the work will cost more or take longer than the quote\nor schedule they originally gave you.\n \nThey have experience working on different types of boats, coatings, and\nfinishes and are capable of dealing with problem areas (specific types of\nstains, scratches, et cetera).\nIf you’re still unsure about who to use, call around. You can find detailers listed\nin The Boaters Yellow Pages (www.boatersyellowpages.com) and on Yachtworld\n(www.yachtworld.com). You can also find business cards posted at your yacht club,\nFrozen hoses and runny noses—good detailers work\nyear-round.\n\nHiring a Detailer 125\nmarina, or favorite boat supply store. Decide to call three to five detailers and ask\neach of them the same questions, including what is their experience, what prod-\nucts do they use, what is their process for washing or waxing a boat, and what are\ntheir rates. It will be easy for you to decide who to choose because, out of five calls,\nmost likely only one or two will call you back!\nThe Cost of Hiring a Detailer\nAs for rates and prices, there are really no set prices in the detailing industry. You\ncan negotiate, but don’t think this is a service you can get at a rock-bottom rate. A\ngood detailer will spend a lot of time and physical exertion and use quality prod-\nucts on your boat. These are worth paying for if you can’t or don’t want to do the\nwork yourself.\nSome detailers charge by the hour and some charge by the foot. If they charge\nby the foot, you’ll know up front exactly what the total cost will be. If they charge\nby the hour, at least ask them to give you an estimate of how long they think the job\nwill take and let you know ahead of time if they expect to exceed that time. If they\ndo exceed the original number of hours, ask them to give you an updated estimate\nand explain why it’s taking longer. They may have run into a few problem areas you\nshould know about or they may have underestimated the job when they first gave\nyou the quote.\nIf they severely underestimated the job, you might question them as to why\nthey didn’t fully realize the scope of the project in the beginning. For example, if\nyou hired a detailer to wax and buff your heavily oxidized boat and they gave you\na “sounds too good to be true” quote, they either low-balled the quote to beat out\nany other bids or they may not have enough experience to know that heavy oxida-\ntion often requires a two-step process, which takes longer, uses more product, and\nrequires a skilled hand at buffing.\nIn trying to negotiate a fair rate or a price that fits your budget, consider two\nthings: (1) Try to do some of the work yourself and (2) decide what’s most impor-\ntant to you. For example, you might be able to save a few dollars if you wash the\nboat yourself so that the detailer has to only wax and buff it. Or, if you feel you have\nthe time and energy to wax and buff the decks and abovedeck structures (usually\nthe easier part of the boat to reach and work on), hire them to wax and buff only the\nhull. Regarding what is most important to you, is your goal a well-protected boat\nor a cosmetically perfect finish? In the case of having your boat waxed, if you’re\n\n126 The Insider’s Guide to Boat Cleaning and Detailing\nmostly concerned with simply protecting the gelcoat with a good layer of wax, a\none-step wax process is all you need. If you are determined to bring back the show-\nroom shine and the gelcoat is heavily oxidized, prepare to pay for a two-step wax\nprocess, which is often double the rate of a one-step process.\nFinally, ask the detailer if there are any additional charges in their rate.\nDepending on your state, some detailers must charge sales tax because their ser-\nvices are considered “retail sales.” However, some might also charge for supplies,\nspecial equipment, gear specifically used for your boat, mileage or other trans-\nportation, and labor fees. Have them itemize and explain any additional charges\nbefore they start the work.\nWorking with a Detailer\nCommunication is key! The first thing you should do when you meet with your new\ndetailer is communicate to them exactly what you want them to do and what your\nexpectations are.\nFor example, if you hire a detailer to wash your boat, are you expecting them\nto clean out the hatches, polish the chrome, wipe down the flybridge, and clean\nthe canvas covers, or simply wash the gelcoat and nonskid? Does washing the\nboat include the dinghy? The detailer might consider “washing a boat” as washing\nthe structure and nonskid of the boat, whereas you might consider that service\nto include everything on the outside of\nthe boat. Tell the detailer exactly what\nyou expect to be included with the ser-\nvice so there are no surprises for either\nof you, both in the quality of the work\nand the final bill.\nDef i n i ng ter m i nolog y i s a l so\nimportant. W hen I’m describing my\nservices to a new customer, I divide the\ngeneral term of “boat cleaning” into\nfour categories. This way, they’ll know\nexactly what my services include and\nI’ll know exactly what they’re expect-\ning. For example:A solid customer-detailer relationship is important.\n\nHiring a Detailer 127\n \nWashing—the boat’s structure, nonskid, and flybridge or helm area\n \nDetailing—cleaning or washing the Isenglass, polishing chrome rails,\ncleaning and brightening vinyl, cleaning out hatches, and cleaning\ncanvas\n \nWaxing—waxing and buffing the boat by hand or with a power buffer,\nusing rubbing compound if needed\n \nInterior cleaning—inside the boat\nHere are few more tips about working with a detailer.\n \nBe realistic about what a detailer can and can’t do for you. Heavily oxidized\nboat? Hire a detailer. Repair hairline cracks? No amount of wax or rub-\nbing compound will buff these away. You’ll need to hire a fiberglass repair\nservice.\n \nDon’t expect a 25-year-old boat or a boat that hasn’t been washed or waxed\nin a long time (a couple of years or more) to look brand new again with a\nsimple one-time wash and wax. It can certainly look good again, but it may\nrequire a few wax jobs to really bring out the gloss of the gelcoat, and it will\ndefinitely need to be put on a regular maintenance program.\n \nIf you’re uncertain about the products a detailer is using, request that they\nuse specific products or provide them with the products you want them to\nuse.\n \nAsk the detailer if they work alone or have a crew. If they have a crew that\ndoes most of the work, ask the detailer how often they check on their crew\nduring the cleaning process. As I’ve always said, a worker won’t care as\nmuch about the job as the business owner has to. Make sure the com-\npany owner or manager is on the job at some point for quality-control\npurposes.\nWhat to Do If the Detailer Missed Something\nIf your detailer missed something the first time around, simply ask if they would\ncome back to take care of that area. Most detailers are looking for specific problem\nareas or stains when cleaning a boat for the first time, as well as simply getting\nto know your boat and all of its nooks and crannies. If you see an area or a stain\n\n128 The Insider’s Guide to Boat Cleaning and Detailing\nthey missed, they didn’t necessarily do a bad job; more possibly they overlooked it\nbecause they were focused on other details. Work with them so they gain a better\nunderstanding of your requirements and expectations, and over time you’ll have\na detailer you can count on who knows your boat inside and out, as well as your\nexpectations.\nIf you ask the detailer to go back and work on an area you thought they missed,\nbut they either refuse or tell you they’ll have to charge you extra for cleaning a cer-\ntain area twice, go back to that area with them and have them show you how they\ncleaned it originally. If they really did miss that spot and they clean the area while\nyou’re looking on, it will instantly look cleaner and it will be obvious if they missed\nit the first time around even if they said they didn’t. If they clean it in front of you\nand the stain or dirt doesn’t go away, removing the stain might require a stronger\ncleaner (for example, wax rather than soap). If you hired someone to wash your\nboat and there are many marks or stains that didn’t come off with the wash, it’s not\nthe boat washer’s fault unless you also asked that person to use wax to remove the\nmarks when they were done washing the boat.\nA Quick Note About the Crew\nBoat detailers that come highly recommended are very busy people and often have\na crew who do most of the work for them. If you’ve met the owner of the detailing\ncompany, most likely they will have looked and acted professionally. That may not\nbe the case for their crew, but don’t judge a book by its cover until you’ve seen their\nwork. I tr y to hire people who actu-\nally want to do this sort of work (boat\nwashing and waxing) as opposed to\nsomeone who just needs a job to earn\na quick buck. But consider that very\nfew people actually choose boat wash-\ning and waxing as their lifelong career.\nTrust me—it’s not why they went to col-\nlege! I know that I may get a good six to\neighteen months out of each detailer I\nhire, either because after that amount\nof time they’ll be ready to move on to a\ndifferent job (maybe they finished col-\nA good detailer learns your boat and knows what it needs\nand when.\n\nHiring a Detailer 129\nlege and are now ready to seek a job in their new field) or the work has become too\nphysically laborious for them and, due to an injury or not wanting to deal with\nphysical labor or harsh weather anymore, they decide to move on.\nHowever, the owner of a good boat detailing company is in this business\nbecause they enjoy the work and they enjoy running their own business. They real-\nize the importance of repeat customers and will try to do whatever it takes, within\nreason, to win your business. Give them time to get to know you and your boat. If\nthings are still getting missed, it might be time to try another detailing service. Tell\neach detailer you’ll give them a couple of chances before you move on to another\ncompany. Remember, boat detailers are only human and have to put up with harsh\nweather, physical labor, and dirty boats. Even detailers have their days!\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\n131\nC h A p t e r\nA Year-Round Plan\nI find checklists helpful because you can use them to follow a plan and know that\nyou’re not forgetting anything. This chapter offers some helpful checklists you can\nput into place every spring, summer, fall, and winter to prepare your boat for boat-\ning and maintain it on a regular basis.\nSpring Checklist\nOne of the best things you can do in winter to prevent small things from becoming\nmajor issues by spring is to simply check on your boat at least once a month when\nyou’re not actively using it. If you use a boat washing service on a regular basis,\nask them to keep an eye out for leaky windows or clogged drains or anything else\nthat could become a larger problem if not easily dealt with during the off months. I\nprovide regular washes for several boat\nowners in the Seattle area and, because\nI’m the one checking on their boat sev-\neral times a month, I’m also the one\nchecking lines before and after a wind-\nstorm, raking fallen leaves before they\nstain the gelcoat brown and purple, and\nalerting the owners of any leaks or other\nissues that need attention. Checking on\nyour boat during the off months can\nmake a big difference once it’s time to\ntackle your pre–boating season check-\n10\nSpring cleaning is a good time to let your boat air out.\n\n132 The Insider’s Guide to Boat Cleaning and Detailing\nlist. Assuming you achieved everything on the winter checklist (which we get to in\na minute), your spring checklist should include the following activities:\n \nAir out the inside. Plan to spend a few hours on your boat one dry or sunny\nday. Open all doors and windows to let in fresh air. Turn on a small fan to\nhelp move the air around.\n \nFreshen fabrics. While you’re airing out the boat, take all fabrics, such as\nbedding, cushions, and towels, that you left on the boat over the winter\nand hang them outside to freshen up. Put them back on the boat only if\nthey’re clean and dry and don’t smell musty. If they do smell musty, bring\nthem home and wash them.\n \nWax your boat! Yes, I am yelling at you. I am a big proponent of waxing\na boat because it’s the best way to protect the gelcoat, help it stand up to\nweather and other elements you can’t control, and make it easier to wash\nand keep clean. And wax keeps oxidation at bay, provided you wax your\nboat on a regular basis—at least once every nine to twelve months. It’s the\nmost eco-friendly cleaner there is because it’s the only cleaner that stays on\nthe surface as opposed to getting hosed off into the water. And fresh wax\nwith a beautiful gloss increases a boat’s resale value, regardless of its age.\n \nCritters. Take a quick look around your boat, especially in the exhaust\nopenings and under the dinghy cover, to make sure no critters have made\nyour boat their home over the winter. Muskrats love to crawl into the\nexhaust openings and burrow in, as well as use that entrance to your boat\nto get into other areas and chew their way around. This doesn’t bode well\nfor any tubes, pipes, or wires they come in contact with. I have found a\nraccoon family making a home in the enclosed flybridge and a bird family\nmaking a home under a dinghy cover on customers’ boats. These present\nhuge, stinky messes to clean up!\n \nMildew. Ahh, mildew—the one constant for all boaters. When you get\ndown to your boat in spring, you will see small black dots of mildew in the\nnonskid and areas of green mildew on the canvas, the rail, and possibly\neven the windowsills if you live in a wet climate. Spritz those areas with a\nmildew spray cleaner and work it in with a soft hand brush. Then wipe it off\nwith a rag or spray it off with a hose.\n \nLook for areas that may need repair. Note potential problem areas—for\nexample, if your boat was tied up in such a way that the swim platform\n\nA Year-Round Plan 133\nbumped the edge of the dock, rubbing the gelcoat off that area. Or if a\nwindstorm caused a piece of debris to nick the gelcoat. Now is the time to\nget those things repaired so they don’t become larger problems later.\nSpring is when most boaters are getting prepared for the boating season. So\nbe aware that if you need to hire a maintenance business or contractor to service\nyour boat, you should contact them in January so you can get on their schedule\nbefore they are booked through August. By the middle of February, my customer\nwaxing schedule is booked well into May or June, so a customer calling in March\nhoping to get their boat waxed the following week is in for a big surprise when I tell\nthem that our next opening is in June.\nSummer and Early Fall Checklist\nThis is the time of year when you should be thoroughly enjoying your boat, whether\nyou’re sitting on it in its slip with an ice cold drink or cruising offshore with your\nfriends and family. If you have prepared your boat in spring, it won’t take much to\nkeep it clean and looking good with these easy detailing tasks.\n \nSchedule a wash program. If your boat is in an uncovered slip or on salt-\nwater or you use it often in the warmer months, put it on a recurring pro-\ngram where it is washed every two to three weeks. If it’s in a covered slip,\nyou can wash it every three to six weeks depending on how many spiders\nhave chosen to live in the rafters above your boat. If you aren’t able to wash\nyour boat this often, consider hiring a boat detailing service to do it for\nyou. They will put your boat on their recurring wash list and you won’t\nhave to worry about coming down to a very dirty boat.\n \nTurn your boat. Every now and then, dock your boat the other way when\nyou come back from a trip. Then the side that is normally in the shade will\nget some sun, or vice versa, which can help prevent one side from becom-\ning more faded or having more mildew growth than the other. Also, it’s\nhard to wash the side of the hull that’s away from the dock, and this will\ngive you a chance to get that side fully clean again.\n \nTouch-up cleaning goes a long way. If your boat was waxed in spring, all\nyou’ll need to do during the more active boating months is use a little\ncleaner wax (such as Meguiar’s Cleaner Wax or SeaPower) to remove bird\n\n134 The Insider’s Guide to Boat Cleaning and Detailing\ndropping stains, scuff marks from shoes, and marks left from a power cord,\nfender, or line rubbing against the gelcoat.\n \nClean and polish plastic windows. After each outing, use a product such\nas Mer-maids Plastic Cleaner or Plexus Plastic Polish to clean the plastic\nwindows. Spray on and wipe off with a clean, dry microfiber rag.\n \nProtect vinyl seats. Vinyl seat cush-\nions and seats can become dr y and\nbr it t le, a nd crack over t i me i f not\ncleaned and protected from UV rays.\nUse Si mple Green or Black St rea k\nRemover spray and a Mr. Clean magic\npad to clean them and bring them back\nto white or their original color. These\nproducts remove dirt and any discol-\noration. Then spray with 303 Aerospace\nProtectant and wipe in with a micro-\nfiber rag. This protects them from UV\nrays and prevents them from drying out\nor cracking.\nWinter Checklist\nNow that Labor Day has passed and the hours of warm temperatures and daylight\nare fewer, it’s time for you fair-weather boaters to start thinking about tucking your\nboat in for a long winter’s nap if you live in a cooler climate. Here’s a list of things\nyou’ll want to do or check before putting your boat away for the winter.\nInterior Checklist\n \nClean and store all fabrics. Remove any fabrics (curtains, bedspreads,\nblankets, towels, et cetera) from the boat, take them to the dry cleaners or\nwash them at home, and store them in your home or a dry storage unit. The\nless fabric and bedding on the boat, the fewer places mildew and moths\ncan find to hide.\n \nClean the cushions. Take any removable cushions to a dry cleaner to have\nthem professionally cleaned and treated for soils and odors. These can go\nAfter cleaning vinyl seats, protect them with a\nUV protectant.\n\nA Year-Round Plan 135\nback on the boat, but prop them up so air can circulate around them. You\nnever know when moisture might seep into your boat, and if cushions are\nupright rather than flat on the benches, there are fewer surfaces that can\nbe contaminated by mildew.\n \nFreshen cabinets. Leave any storage cabinets and cupboards slightly ajar\nto air them out. I have found the storage compartments on some boats so\nairtight that if a small amount of moisture gets into them, they become\na breeding ground for mold and mildew since no oxygen can get into the\ncompartment to combat it.\n \nClean out the fridge and food cupboards. Take food and beverage items off\nthe boat to store at home or throw away. You really don’t need to keep those\nseventeen half-eaten bags of potato chips for next year, so discard them\nnow and start your collection all over again in spring. Clean out the fridge\ncompletely. Yes, even the ketchup! Take it all home or throw it out. I have\nnever come across any food item or condiment that has improved with age\nin a boat fridge. Most condiments mysteriously drip, and most pop cans\neventually explode. Get them all off your boat, clean the fridge, and wipe\nit completely dry. Place a box of baking soda in both the fridge and freezer.\nYou might even want to turn off the fridge and leave it slightly ajar so it\ndoesn’t grow mildew over the winter.\n \nConsider the unmentionable. The more things you can take off your boat,\nthe better. And I say this not just with mildew in mind. Consider what you\nmight lose if a natural disaster were to occur, whether it be a storm, a fire,\nor the roof of your covered slip collapsing. If something were to happen to\nyour boat, would you know what was on it so you could replace it? Remove\nanything that’s priceless or expensive and make a checklist of everything\nthat’s left with an estimate of what it might be worth. If certain items must\nremain on the boat (electronics, audio and video equipment, et cetera),\nwrite down their serial numbers so you can give them to the insurance\ncompany. Additionally, make sure you know who your insurance company\ncontact is and have their number in a handy place. It’s no fun having to\nconsider these things, but it’s extremely helpful to have the information\nhandy if anything does happen.\n \nCondition the air inside. Boats that are rained on all winter can smell\nmusty or feel damp inside over time, especially older boats, wooden boats,\nand sailboats that don’t have a fully sealed entry hatch where water can\n\n136 The Insider’s Guide to Boat Cleaning and Detailing\nleak in. If you can safely put a space heater in the main salon where it’s\nfar enough from any fabrics or cords, this will be your best bet in keeping\nyour boat at a warm enough air temperature to keep things dry. Of course,\nyour goal is to condition the air so it doesn’t cause humid conditions or\ndampness. A small portable air conditioner or dehumidifier will take the\nmoisture out of the air and help prevent any moisture from “setting in” to\nthe fabrics and wood grain of the boat interior. An ionizer helps, as well. If\nyou are using a space heater, also set up a small fan to better circulate the\nair. Once a musty smell has set in to cushions, carpets, or any other fabric,\nit can be difficult to eliminate.\n \nMow the grass in the windowsills. If you have any window leaks, now is\nthe time to get the leaks fixed or the gaps filled. This is also a good time to\nmake sure your windows, doors, and hatches are still well sealed. Mildew\nloves to grow in windowsills on boats (especially Grand Banks window-\nsills), so don’t allow it to even start. Spritz the windowsills with a mildew\nspray cleaner and follow it up with Clo-\nrox bleach spray. This will kill the mil-\ndew and prevent it from coming back in\nthe near future. You can also lay a strip\nof fabric (part of an old towel, for exam-\nple) in the sill to soak up any condensa-\ntion that might occur. If untreated, the\nmildew can grow in the area between\nthe windows (where they meet in the\nmiddle), and the only way to reach that\narea to fully kill the mildew and clean it\nis to remove the windows.\nExterior Checklist\n \nWax on, wax off. Wax is the best protectant for your boat. There are many\nbenefits to a freshly waxed boat. Stains don’t “soak in” to the gelcoat as eas-\nily; you can go longer between washes; water stains wash off easier; and,\nof course, your boat is protected from harmful UV rays. If your boat hasn’t\nbeen waxed in a while, consider waxing it (or hiring a detailer to wax it) so\nyou don’t have to wash it as much over the winter. Or, if you had your whole\nMoss on a windowsill\n\nA Year-Round Plan 137\nboat waxed in spring, just wax the deck and abovedeck structures again\nbefore winter. By then, they will need it from all the sun and weather expo-\nsure they received from summer, and these areas take more of a beating\nfrom winter weather conditions as well. Waxing them again before winter\nwill make it much easier to clean and maintain them come spring.\n \nPrevent mildew from attacking your canvas. Spritz the canvas with a\nmildew spray cleaner on a regular basis to help prevent mildew from set-\nting in. Once the canvas looks as though it might be easier to mow than\nto scrub, you are too late in the fight against mildew. If you have a ski boat\nor an enclosed flybridge, make sure there is some sort of ventilation com-\ning through the canvas, either with a mesh patch to let air in or simply\nby not tightening the canvas completely in one area. Even though the\ncanvas cover will keep out the rain, it won’t keep the air dry. The moist\nair that develops under the canvas cover can foster the growth of mil-\ndew, and even when warm days are forecast, without ventilation there is\nno way for the air to dry up enough to prevent the mildew from growing\nfurther. Have your local canvas maker add a few ventilation patches in\nyour canvas cover, or leave a small section somewhat loose so air can flow\nthrough.\n \nBring in all exterior cushions. I know they are labeled “weatherproof” or\n“water resistant,” but that means only if a little rain gets on them. It doesn’t\nmean they can withstand rain or other moisture for long periods of time.\nMildew grows quickly in wet cushions, no matter what material they’re\nmade of, and if left for a long time, it can be difficult to remove. Consider\nthat the longer a stain sits, the harder you’ll have to scrub or the stronger\nthe cleaner you’ll have to use. Both break down the material you’re trying\nto clean, which makes it harder to clean the next time. Such a vicious little\ncircle cleaning can be!\n \nClean out clogged drains. The next time you wash your boat, notice\nwhether it’s taking a while for any drains to clear or if any drains are out-\nright clogged. If they’re draining slowly now, they’ll only get worse once\nthe leaves start to fall (if your boat is near any trees) or from any other\ndebris that falls onto your boat. Spray the hose directly into the drains at\nfull pressure to make sure they’re clear. If they still aren’t draining, or if\nyou can tell that something is in there, use a wire or narrow PVC tube to\npoke into the drain and try to push any debris through it.\n\n138 The Insider’s Guide to Boat Cleaning and Detailing\n \nMove outdoor deck carpets in. As with canvas, any fabric that remains\noutside will surely grow mildew. Although it isn’t the end of the world for\nthose items, it will cause you a lot more work in spring when all you have to\ndo right now is roll up the outdoor deck carpets and store them inside. Just\nthink—if you move them inside now, you won’t have to spend more than a\nminute dusting them off in spring!\n \nDrive the spiders crazy. Or better yet, drive them away. Spider droppings\nthat sit on fabric, vinyl, or gelcoat for long periods of time can soak in and\nare hard to fully remove. Even heavy-\nduty rubbing compound doesn’t always\ntake out the stains. You’ll always be\nleft with a small tan circle to remind\nyou that all you had to do was this one\nsimple task: Go to your local hardware\nstore and buy a plug-in ultrasonic spi-\nder repeller. Plug it into the flybridge or\nhelm area of your boat (or someplace\nwhere it won’t get wet from rain) and\nwatch the spiders leave and know that\nthey won’t come back! These devices emit a super-high-pitched sound that\ninterrupts their daily living (eating, mating, weaving webs) and prevents\nthem from going anywhere near that area.\n \nDon’t leave the leaves. As soon as leaves fall onto your boat, hose them\noff. You may have to do this several times until the tree near your boat\nhas finished “falling.” If left on the gelcoat, the leaves cause a brown stain\nonce they get wet. If allowed to soak in (even on a waxed boat), the stains\nare hard to remove. It requires a lot of rubbing compound and some pretty\nstrong UV rays to help bleach them out over time.\n \nDon’t let the dinghy get dingy. If you’ve just brought the dinghy out of the\nwater, clean it up while it’s still wet. Algae, once dry, cause a brown stain\non the hull that is difficult to remove. Spray the inflatable areas with Inflat-\nable Boat Cleaner, let it sit, scrub it in with a soft bristled brush, and hose it\noff. To clean dried algae off the bottom, spray it with a rust remover spray\n(such as Rust SprayAway), use a soft hand brush to spread it around that\narea, and hose it off.\nThis ultrasonic device drives spiders crazy—and away.\n\nA Year-Round Plan 139\nThis might look like a lot of work at first, but if you can tackle these things over\na few days, you’ll be a lot happier next spring when you don’t have to mow the grass\nout of the windowsills, scrape dried Coke and ketchup from the fridge, or paint the\nrest of the dinghy brown to match the dried algae stains on the bottom of it. A little\nprevention goes a long way!\nKeep It Up or Let It Go\nThat seems to be the question many of us ask as we look at the mildew encroaching\non our canvas bimini top or the spider droppings on our white vinyl seat cushions.\nShould I keep after those things on a regular basis, or is it all right to just let it go till\nlater? Many of us just don’t have the time at the beginning and end of each boating\nseason or during the off months to keep on top of these things. Or maybe you have\nplenty of time, but cleaning your bilge just isn’t on your list. I’m all for procrastina-\ntion, so here are the boat detailing projects you should stay on top of and the ones\nyou can save for later.\nWax It Away\nThe more often you wax your boat (at least twice per year), the more time you can\nlet go in between washes; for example, instead of washing it every two or three\nweeks, you might be able to get away with every four or five weeks. Wax protects\nthe gelcoat from harmful UV rays, as well as general wear and tear, scuff marks,\nand water stains. It prevents bird droppings from “soaking in” and helps prevent\nthe gelcoat from oxidizing over time.\nI always suggest to my customers that they wax their hull once a year and\nwax the decks and abovedeck structures twice each year, once in spring and once\nbefore winter. The decks and abovedeck structures get hit more directly with UV\nrays, as well as water stains and bird droppings, so these areas are the first to fade.\nWaxing them every six months will keep them looking good year-round.\nIf It’s Yellow\nActually, no matter what color it is, don’t let it mellow. Flush your tanks on a regu-\nlar basis if they’re used often, and definitely before you put the boat away for the\n\n140 The Insider’s Guide to Boat Cleaning and Detailing\nwinter. There is nothing worse than boarding your boat in spring for the first time\nonly to be reminded by the smell of the heads of just how many parties you had on\nthe boat the previous season. (Sorry to be so graphic, but that ought to make you\nrun out and pump the tanks right now!)\nLikewise, if there is anything damp inside the boat, such as cushions, towels,\ncurtains, or other fabrics, take them out and clean them (throw them in the wash-\ning machine or get them dry cleaned), and make sure they’re completely dry before\nputting them back in the boat (or store them in a dry storage place off the boat).\nThis is definitely not something you want to let go!\nKeep on top of carpet stains as they occur, simply because it’s easier to remove\na fresh stain than one that has thoroughly soaked into the carpet fibers. Use water\nand vinegar or products like Folex or an “oxy” cleaner to spot-clean. And it’s a good\nidea to get the carpets professionally steam cleaned once a year to keep overall\ntraffic areas from becoming too soiled. If you let your carpets go, eventually spot\ncleaning won’t make a difference and in fact will actually make the carpets look\nworse. You’ll have a few really clean spots while the rest of the carpet is slightly\ndarker from being soiled by foot and paw traffic over time.\nGeneral interior cleaning is something you can let go until you need to spiff\nup the boat for a party or take it out for the first time in spring. The crumbs you left\nin the galley drawers or on the counter won’t grow over winter into larger, more\nmenacing crumbs. They’ll be the same little crumbs they were at the end of the\nseason and can easily be vacuumed up whenever you get a chance.\nThe Green Monster\nEventually, mildew will find your boat and attach itself to your lovely canvas, espe-\ncially around the edges and zippers. You can let it go for a while, but you want\nto treat it and scrub it off before it turns into thicker, mosslike mildew or it will\nnot only be much more difficult to remove, it will eventually weaken the integ-\nrity of the canvas from all the hard scrubbing it takes to remove it. The best way\nto prevent mildew from winning the race is to clean your canvas with boat soap\nand water and a mild scrub brush. Then, while it’s wet, spritz it with mildew spray\ncleaner (Lysol or Tilex) or Mold Off (www.moldoff.org) and let it soak into the can-\nvas. Mildew spray cleaners are effective for several weeks, helping keep mildew at\nbay without a lot of work on your part.\n\nA Year-Round Plan 141\nAlthough it’s not green, rust is another stain that should be treated on a regu-\nlar basis. Often I see rust stains dripping down the side of the boat from a stan-\nchion or other metal object. If they haven’t been there for a long time, I can easily\nremove them with a spray that removes rust from fiberglass (available at boat sup-\nply stores). And, of course, if you have a good coat of wax on your boat, the rust\nstain will sit on top of it and not eat into the gelcoat, provided you treat the stain\nevery so often and keep that area waxed. However, it’s best to treat the rust prob-\nlem at the source. Find out why rust is developing in that area. Maybe something\nneeds to be resealed or a metal screw or stanchion needs to be replaced. If left to\nsit for a long time, rust stains can be difficult to remove from gelcoat and might\neventually need to be wet-sanded off and the area re-waxed.\nBirds, Leaves, and Spiders\nThose three things are probably what most frustrate boaters who try to keep their\nboat clean. If your boat has a good coat of wax, droppings and leaves can remain\non the gelcoat without permanently staining it, but it’s still better to get after these\nthings as often as you can. If you don’t have much time, keep a hose handy at your\nslip and simply hose off your boat every week or two. Even if you don’t scrub away\nthe stains, just getting the top layer of them sprayed off with a hose will allow the\nsun to bleach out the stain. The same thing goes for brown and purple leaf stains.\nHose off the leaves and let the sun bleach out the stains; it will take only a day or\ntwo. But that’s why you want a good coat of wax on your gelcoat. If the sun is strong\nenough to “remove” stains on the gelcoat, just think what it’s doing to the gelcoat\nitself!\nWashing your boat is something you can let go for a month or two if you have\na good coat of wax on it or you moor it in a covered slip. Sure, there may be more\nwater stains dripping down your gelcoat, but with a good coat of wax, they’ll wipe\nor wash right off the next time you wash your boat. Without a good coat of wax,\nthey will be more difficult to remove and will require more scrubbing, or you’ll\nhave to wax them off with a cleaner wax. It’s a vicious circle—if you don’t keep your\nboat waxed, you’ll end up having to wax it just to get the stains out!\nWater stains are a natural occurrence. The best way to remove them quickly\n(if you don’t have time to wash your boat) is to spray them with vinegar or Simple\nGreen and wipe them away with a rag. Don’t use anything stronger than that; it\n\n142 The Insider’s Guide to Boat Cleaning and Detailing\nwill remove the wax in that area, which is most likely the area that needs wax the\nmost because that’s where the water stains accumulate. (Like I said, it’s a vicious\ncircle.)\nThe Hour-a-Week Boat-Cleaning Plan\nIf you have only an hour each week or want to spend only an hour each week main-\ntaining the cleanliness and appearance of your boat, here is a short checklist of the\ntasks you should spend your time on.\n1. When you arrive at your boat, stand on the dock and look it over as a\nwhole. Anything amiss will catch your eye immediately, such as a panel\nof canvas flapping in the breeze (possibly marking the gelcoat each time\nthe metal snap hits it) or possibly a ding in the gelcoat. Make a mental\nnote to take care of these issues soon.\n2. If you have more than an hour, plan to wash your boat. But assuming\nyou don’t, take out the hose and just hose down the decks. Don’t get the\nrest of the boat wet or you will have just turned the light layer of dust\non your boat into a light layer of mud and it will be even dirtier the next\ntime you come down. Just hose the decks and make sure the drains\naren’t clogged with leaves or debris.\n3. Your glass windows will be dusty, so grab a few microfiber rags and\nsome window cleaner such as SprayWay or Plexus and spray and wipe\nthem down. Your plastic and Lexan windows will also be dusty, so use\na microfiber rag and a cleaner such as Meguiar’s or Mer-maids Plastic\nCleaner to spray and wipe down those windows or panels.\n4. With your damp rags from cleaning the windows, provided they’re not\ntoo dirty, wipe down the helm station area in the enclosed flybridge\nif you have one. A clean rag with either of the window sprays will also\nwork well on the dash area.\n5. Take a spray bottle of Simple Green, a bottle of cleaner wax, and a\nmicrofiber rag and walk around the exterior of the boat looking for\nwater stains, scuff marks, and bird dropping stains. First try wiping\nthem clean with just the rag and Simple Green. If they don’t come out,\n\nA Year-Round Plan 143\napply a small amount of cleaner wax, rub it in, and wipe it off. This is a\ngood way to remove any marks and stains in between washes.\n6. The interior of your boat shouldn’t be too dirty if you cleaned it after\neach outing. Keep a small portable vacuum cleaner on the boat if you\ndon’t have a central vacuum system. This way, you can quickly vacuum\naround the edges of the floor, the countertops, and over the cushions\nto remove most of the crumbs and dirt. Then take a microfiber rag or\na duster and simply dust all flat surfaces—counters, tables, ledges, the\nedge of bookcases, etc. Check the toilets while you’re there and do a\nquick swish of the toilet brush if needed. Check the fridge to make sure\nnothing has leaked or dripped or is growing and staging a coup against\nyou.\nIf you do these six tasks on a regular basis, even every other week, you’re one\nbig step ahead of ever having so much dirt, dust, and debris on your boat that it\ntakes a full day to clean it. This, of course, assumes that you wax your boat at least\nonce a year and wash it at least once a month if it’s moored in an uncovered slip.\nA little care on a more regular basis will go further in the effort to keep your boat\nlooking good and in good condition. It’s not nearly as overwhelming as trying to\ndo it all in one weekend, and it allows for a little more procrastination over time—\nsomething we can all enjoy!\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\n145\nA p p e n d I x A\nSelling Your Boat\nThe day you decide to sell your boat will surely cause you to experience a wide\nrange of emotions, but the emotion that will sneak up on you and surprise you the\nmost is that of awe. You’ll stand there on the aft deck looking into your boat and\nrealize just how much stuff you have on and in your boat that you now have to get\noff your boat!\nIt was so easy for you or your spouse or your friends to bring that one bag of\npotato chips or that liter of soda pop or that box of crackers for the opening day\nparade you had in 1979, but it’s all still on the boat! Along with all of the canned\ngoods and Ziploc bags you stocked up on just in case that small marina you were\nstopping at didn’t have those items.\nThe day has come when you must enter your floating storage unit and turn it\nback into a clean and spacious boat. It can be a daunting task, but if you divide the\nwork over a week and invite everyone who ever brought a bag of potato chips or box\nof crackers onto your boat to help out, you’ll get it done in no time!\nExterior Detailing\nYour first task is to make the outside of the boat look good. This is where the first\nimpression will be made, and if the first impression is made in the first five sec-\nonds, as they say, you want the gloss on your gelcoat to be what catches their eye,\nnot the water stains or the green mildew growing along the windowsills.\nStart by emptying out exterior lazarettes and storage compartments. First,\ntake everything out of them and clean the inside. Ideally, the lazarettes and stor-\n\n146 Selling Your Boat\nage compartments should be empty and their contents removed from the boat or\nput in your dock box, but if you must keep some items in the exterior compart-\nments, choose things that are useful or have a purpose there and fit neatly into the\ncompartment.\nAfter you’ve cleaned out the exterior compartments, it’s time to wash the\nboat. Your scrub brush or sponge should touch every inch of the boat to make sure\neverything gets clean. Potential buyers will look under things, test things, and lift\nup every hatch on the boat. Once they buy the boat, they may never touch or notice\nthese things again, but that doesn’t matter. Everything needs to be clean for their\nfirst tug at the hatch. Spend some time in the flybridge or helm area and wipe the\ndashes clean, as well as the inside of the Isenglass or windows.\nIf your boat hasn’t been waxed in a while or is starting to look more matte\nthan glossy, consider waxing it to bring back the gloss. Obviously, the last thing you\nwant to do when selling your boat is to spend more money on it. If you hire some-\none to wax it, have them wax only the decks and abovedeck structures, which are\nthe main areas of the boat that potential buyers will see as they’re walking up to or\naround the boat.\nClean up canvas and vinyl as best you can. If the cushions or canvas covers\nare in bad shape (green, wet, and mildewy), take them off the boat, clean them,\nand allow them to dry before putting them back on the boat or storing them\nelsewhere.\nA few other exterior detailing tips:\n \nClean fenders and power cords with acetone or inflatable boat cleaner and\na Mr. Clean magic pad to get them spotless and looking as good as new.\n \nBleach any mildewy lines with mildew spray cleaner.\n \nPull up any exterior carpet that is in rain’s way so it doesn’t mildew over\ntime. Leave any carpet in the covered flybridge or helm area. It looks nice\nand will protect the nonskid, but you’ll need to check it every now and then\nand vacuum or shake it out.\n \nIf the last time you took the boat out was that opening day parade in 1979\nand your registration tabs show 1979 as the latest year, remove them!\n \nMake it easy to board your boat, whether that means turning it bow in\nor stern in depending on your dock configuration, or placing a step stool\nwhere needed.\n\nSelling Your Boat 147\nInterior Cleaning\nCleaning the interior of your boat will make the exterior cleaning you just did seem\nlike a breeze. (I didn’t want to tell you this earlier.) Bring empty boxes, paper bags,\nplastic garbage bags, cleaning rags and paper towels, cleaning products (you prob-\nably already have them on your boat), and your favorite music.\nStart by emptying out the cupboards, drawers, and storage compartments.\nVacuum and clean them out well. You can put back a few useful or practical items if\nyou must, but take as much as you can home with you. You’ll have to remove these\nthings from your boat eventually, so you might as well start now. Besides, your goal\nis to create a clean and spacious look. Better to let potential buyers see how spa-\ncious the storage compartments are rather than show them just how much stuff\nyou can cram in there!\nPolish wood walls, doors, and trim with an orange oil spray. This will give\nthem an attractive sheen and help the boat smell good. Clean the head with a\nfresh-smelling cleaner like Pine-Sol and pour tank treatment into the toilet. An\neasy way to start cleaning the galley is to simply vacuum all the crumbs from the\nstove, stovetop, and drawers, then spray with a cleaner to remove any remaining\nmarks, dirt, or stains.\nClean out the fridge well. Remove everything, then wipe it out, including stor-\nage bins and trays, and wipe out the freezer. You may want to defrost the freezer\nand keep it turned off and the door ajar. Either way, be sure to thoroughly dry the\ninside of the fridge and freezer (if you defrosted it) so that water doesn’t cause any\nmildew to grow over time. Then put a box of baking soda in the fridge and another\none in the freezer to keep these spaces fresh.\nSetting the Stage\nStaging is something real estate agents\ndo well. This helps potential buyers\nvisualize their dream. You can do the\nsame type of staging with your boat.\nOnce you’ve cleaned the interior and\nremoved most or all of your personal\nitems, you can bring select items back\non the boat that will add to its ambi- A nicely staged boat for sale\n\n148 Selling Your Boat\nance. Set the table for two with attrac-\ntive, clean placemats, decorative plates,\ncloth napkins, and even a bottle of wine\nwith two wineglasses.\nHang a decorative dish towel and\nmatching oven mitt near the stove. Put\na teapot on the stove with an attractive\nteacup and saucer on the counter. Put\nsilk flowers on a table and a fresh towel\nin the berth with a good-smelling bar of\nsoap on the sink. Lay a throw blanket\nover the bed with a book.\nThe goal with staging is to make\nthe boat feel comfortable and inviting\nto help potential buyers imagine them-\nselves having a nice meal with someone\non their boat, making a warm cup of tea\non a cold day, or curling up with a good\nbook. But avoid the cluttered look, and\nmake sure all items used for staging are\nclean and look new.\nTa ke photos of your boat on ly\nafter you’ve cleaned and staged it. Use\na camera with a wide-angle lens so people can get a better idea of your boat’s layout\ninstead of showing tiny, cramped-looking rooms.\nThese suggestions will make your boat look better to potential buyers and\nbe much easier to sell, whether you’re selling it on your own or through a broker-\nage. If your boat hasn’t sold in the first month after you’ve thoroughly cleaned it,\nyou’ll want to wash it at least once a month and check the interior each time you’re\naboard. If a lot of people have been viewing your boat, you may need to vacuum the\ninterior, dust surface areas, and make sure the toilet is clean.\nIf you’re selling your current boat to buy a bigger and better boat, just remem-\nber that bigger simply means more places to store bags of potato chips, boxes of\ncrackers, and cleaning products. Tell your friends that if they board with one bag\nof chips, they have to leave with two.\nSpotlight on Staging\n”You never get a second chance to make a first\nimpression.”\nThat’s the mantra of home-staging experts in the\nreal estate world. These designers practice the fine\nart of manipulating a visitor’s first impression, via\ncarefully placed (or removed) items of décor. Be it\nhouse . . . or boat.\nFor pre-owned boats, the goal is to minimize the\n‘lived-in’ look. Stagers thin out the owner’s personal\nitems and neutralize the overall aesthetic. Removing\nan owner’s mark from the boat allows potential\nbuyers to better picture themselves in the space.\nBrand new boats, on the other hand, need staging\nto infuse life into them. Or the suggestion of what life\ncould be like, aboard. Achieve this by adding splashes\nof color and zest throughout. Be it a vase of fresh\nflowers, some gorgeous coffee table books, fluffy\ntowels in the bathroom, a bowl of fruit in the galley\nand vibrant pillows on beds and couches.\nNeed inspirations? Grab a home design magazine\nand emulate what you see. If it’s good enough for a\nhouse, it’s good enough for a boat!\n—Cherie Hasson, Windermere Real Estate, Seattle\n(www.homesbycherie.com)\n\n149\nA p p e n d I x B\nCritter Prevention\nThere is no doubt about it that spiders and other insects love boats! And the closer\nyour boat is moored to a shore, wetlands, or vegetation, the more insects and spi-\nders your boat will attract. With all those juicy little insects come hungry little\nbirds. Once they’ve eaten some of the insects, guess what comes with now full little\nbirds? Yes, bird droppings. (And guess what comes with spiders? Spider droppings!)\nThen there are otters and muskrats that target your boat because your swim plat-\nform makes an excellent sunning deck for them, as well as a great place to rest\nand eat the crab they just caught. And your exhaust opening makes an excellent\nhideaway.\nIn the years that I’ve been detailing boats, I have come across interesting\nmethods that boaters use to scare away critters. Most of these methods have scared\nonly me (inflatable pythons and masks) or, thanks to my poor depth perception,\nhave caused only me to trap myself in the owner’s strategically placed fishing\nwire. Although annoying (because I’m\nusually the one having to clean up after\nthese critters), I find it humorous when\nI see seventeen little sparrows sitting\non the inf latable snake or surround-\ning the plastic owl perched on the hard\ntop as if it were their fearless leader.\nSomehow these sparrows must inher-\nently know that pythons, in their non-\ninflatable form, don’t actually exist in\nNorth America. This fake bird most likely won’t scare off the real ones.\n\n150 Critter Prevention\nIf it is true that acidic pigeon droppings can cause a steel bridge to deterio-\nrate, imagine what similar bird or spider droppings can do to your gelcoat, vinyl,\nplastic windows, and canvas. It takes time for the acid in these droppings to do\nmuch damage, but if they’re sitting on unprotected fabrics or gelcoat, they can\nslowly deteriorate that material. The following section lists each type of critter, the\nmess they can make, the damage they can do, how to clean up after them, and how\nto prevent them from taking over your boat.\nBird Droppings\nThe slight acidic content in all animal droppings can eat into the material they’re\nsitting on if the droppings are not removed on a regular basis. Bird droppings are\nmost annoying for making your boat’s deck and abovedeck structures look like\nPicasso masterpieces with their colorful splotches, especially in fall when birds are\neating berries. If you haven’t waxed your gelcoat in a while (more than a year), bird\ndroppings can actually “soak into” the porous gelcoat and become even more diffi-\ncult to remove without using heavy-duty rubbing compound or chemical cleaners.\nTherefore, the first and foremost defense is to keep your boat waxed. Even if the\ninflatable Komodo dragon is scaring away the birds from landing on your rails, not\nmuch can stop those birds flying overhead from hitting your boat. If your gelcoat\nhas wax on it, these stains will sit on top of the wax instead of the gelcoat itself.\nOne of the only bird deterrent systems I’ve seen work fairly well is stringing fish-\ning wire near the rails and other areas\nwhere you don’t want birds perching.\nFishing wire is very thin yet somewhat\nreflective, so although birds can see that\nsomething is there, they’re not able to\nfocus on it and therefore don’t feel safe\nlanding in that area. You can also tie\ntwo-foot-long pieces of mylar flash tape\n(sold at hardware and household variety\nstores) on the rail every twelve inches\nor so in other areas where birds congre-\ngate. Choose silver flash tape if you can\nfind it because the colored tapes can run\nonto gelcoat or metal if they get wet.Mylar flash tape scares birds away from your railings.\n\nCritter Prevention 151\nIf your boat has been covered with bird droppings, the first thing to do is\ngive it a good soapy wash. Don’t spend time at this point trying to scrub off the\nbird droppings. Your main goal is simply to remove the crusty top layer. After thor-\noughly rinsing, you’ll still see a colorful mark where the bird dropping was, but\nnow you can more easily remove the stain in one of two ways. You can remove it\nyourself, or you can let nature do the work, which means letting the sun bleach\nout the stain naturally. It takes only a few days and the stain will be gone or sig-\nnificantly lightened. If you want to remove the stain yourself, take some cleaner\nwax (such as 3M Cleaner Wax) and a microfiber rag and rub a small amount of the\ncleaner over the stain until it lightens or is gone completely. Then buff off the wax\ndust with another corner of the rag.\nSpider Droppings\nThose little black dots you see all over\nthe white vinyl seats in your enclosed\ncockpit are spider droppings. Spiders\nlove living in enclosed cockpits and fly-\nbridges because it’s typically warmer in\nthere and they have many good hiding\nplaces, as well as places to make their\nnests and birth their millions of babies.\nThis is one critter you want to extermi-\nnate on a regular basis simply because\nthey reproduce so rapidly and in such\nhigh numbers.\nFirst, remove their black dot drop-\npings by spraying Simple Green on the\nvinyl over each black dot and let it sit for\nabout 30 seconds. This will loosen the\ndropping and you’ll easily be able to\nwipe it off with a rag. You can follow up\nby using 303 Aerospace Protectant on all of the vinyl to protect it from UV rays as\nwell as prevent spider droppings from soaking in.\nYou can remove the spiders from your enclosed cockpit or flybridge area in\none of two ways—with an ultrasonic pest control device or with an insect spray\nSpider dropping stains\n\n152 Critter Prevention\nor a fogger. To be effective, an ultrasonic pest control device needs to be plugged\ninto a receptacle in your enclosed cockpit area. The device works best when it’s\npositioned close to where the spiders are actually living and nesting. It sends out\nan ultrasonic sound that people and dogs cannot hear. Spiders can hear it and it\nbasically disrupts their lifestyle in that area, causing them to evacuate and find\nanother place (that is, another boat) to live in. You will need to change the device\nabout every three months because spiders eventually get used to a certain pitch\nand it will no longer be effective. Simply buy a different brand with a slightly dif-\nferent pitch.\nIf you’re able to be off your boat for a full 24-hour period, you might consider\nfogging the enclosed area. Buy a fogger that specifically kills spiders and their eggs.\nSet the fogger in the middle of the enclosed area, push the trigger, and leave the\narea immediately. When you come back the next day, open as many windows or\npanels as you can to let fresh air in while you clean up after the fogger and vacuum\nup everything that dropped from the spiders’ hiding places.\nMuskrats\nMuskrats aren’t known for making messes on boats, but rather sinking them. They\nenter through your exhaust outlet and chew their way into the boat. They’ll chew\nthrough anything, and the more they chew through, the more water is let into the\nhull, bilge, or engine room of your boat. The best way to prevent any critter from\nentering your boat underwater is to put metal mesh screens over all underwater\nopenings.\nOtters\nAlthough cute, otters can make a huge, stinky mess on your boat with all of their\ndiscarded crab shells and droppings. They enjoy sunning themselves on swim\nplatforms and eating their shellfish dinner there, too. If you come across this, just\nhose off the area where they’ve been, scrub it with soap and water, and rinse well.\nIf there are stains on the nonskid or decking from their little shenanigans, you can\nremove them the same way you would remove bird droppings. Either let the sun\n\nCritter Prevention 153\nbleach them out or remove them with rubbing compound. Make sure this area is\nwaxed to prevent future stains from soaking in.\nSome people rig up wire with an electric current passing through it to prevent\notters from getting on their boat. If you can’t do this at your slip (most marinas\ndon’t allow it), you may simply need to wash this area on a regular basis or as often\nas the otters are using your boat.\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\n155\nA p p e n d I x C\nDiving Services\nIf a diver is coming to your boat to replace the zincs, check your propeller, or find\nyour keys, it would also be a good time to have the diver clean the bottom of your\nboat. How often is enough?\nIf you moor your boat in fresh water, you should need to do this only when\nyou have your zincs checked. If you moor your boat in an area with active marine\ngrowth (coral, barnacles, algae, and other such growth), you will need to have the\nbottom of your boat cleaned on a regular basis. How often depends on the type of\nmarine growth in your area and how quickly it comes back once scrubbed off. If\ncoral is an issue, it should be cleaned off every few weeks. The coral that accumu-\nlates on a boat bottom with poor or no antifouling paint can grow so large that it\nrequires removal with a scraper instead of a steel wool pad. If a scraper is needed,\nit will take more time to do the job and therefore cost more money. The boat’s per-\nformance can also become compromised due to coral fouling the hull, propellers,\nand engine water intakes and can cause the engine to overheat as well.\nIf you moor your boat in an area with less aggressive marine growth, you\nshould have the bottom cleaned every four to five weeks year-round. These recom-\nmendations are for boat bottoms with bottom paint rated in fair to good condition.\nBoat bottoms and outdrives with poor or no paint should be cleaned every two to\nfour weeks depending on the marine growth in your area. The goal is to clean the\nbottom on a regular basis so a scraper doesn’t have to be used, thus degrading the\nremaining bottom paint or scratching the gelcoat. If the diver has to scrape off a\nconsiderable amount of marine growth each time he or she goes under your boat,\ntoo much time has elapsed between cleanings. Boat bottom cleaning should be\n\n156 Diving Services\nscheduled more often to avoid excessive marine growth and loss of the boat’s per-\nformance. Less drag can help increase boat speed and improve fuel efficiency.\nWhile the diver is under your boat, have them clean all unpainted metal\nsurfaces such as props, shafts, trim tabs, struts, rudders, engine intakes, and out-\ndrives. You might also suggest that they check and clear all of the through-hulls,\nspeedometer wheels, and depth sounder transducers.\n\n157\nA p p e n d I x d\nCruising with Your\nNon-Boating\nFriends\nWhen the weatherman predicts sunny skies and warm temperatures for opening\nday weekend, all the people you promised a boat ride to at the office or on your\nbrother’s wife’s side of the family will start coming forward, dropping hints about\nhow nice it must be out on the lake this time of year. It doesn’t matter than none of\nthem has ever set foot on a boat. You will invite them and they will come and you\nwill spend the whole cruise making sure they don’t break or clog the head, fall off\nthe boat, or get seasick on your new settee.\nThere are many ways you can make your non-boating friends feel safe and\ncomfortable on your boat while at the same time allowing yourself a little freedom\nfrom constantly “babysitting” or giving instructions to your guests. Before they\narrive, clean and organize your boat so it’s easier for them to move around and to\nfind things. Once they arrive, tell them what to expect once you’re under way and\nhow to use things on board. The following tips might help.\nClothing and Gear\nYour friends have most likely seen many boat advertisements with a beautiful\nwoman in a swimsuit sunning herself on the forward deck or a group of longtime\nfriends enjoying a glass of wine on the aft deck, all wearing white pants, a pink\nbutton-down shirt, and a seafoam green argyle sweater tied over their shoulders.\n\n158 Cruising with Your Non-Boating Friends\nRarely do these polished advertisements show what it’s really like when a squall\nsuddenly takes over your blue sky and you have to wear your argyle sweater as a hat\nto keep your head warm and somewhat dry.\nThe best way to help your non-boating friends prepare for their cruise is to\nsend them a written invitation that suggests some items they should bring for their\nown comfort. Let them know that the weather can change quickly and that even\nthe slightest breeze, when you’re out on the water, can feel much cooler than what\nthey’re used to on their west-facing sundeck at home. This list should include a\nwarm sweater or jacket, sunglasses, and a light rain jacket. They should bring a ver-\nsatile hat that can protect them from sun, rain, or cooler temperatures. If you have\na few extra raincoats (or you can buy cheap plastic raincoats at the drugstore), pack\nthem in a bag in case any of your guests needs one. Pack a few extra sweatshirts or\nhats if you have them as well. This will ensure that everyone is comfortable, even if\nthey didn’t pack the right gear for themselves.\nAnother important issue you’ll need to tackle is encouraging your friends to\nwear the right footwear. Of course, you don’t want them slipping around on the\ndeck, but you especially don’t want heel marks in your teak or black scuff marks all\nover your freshly washed nonskid. When it comes to footwear, it seems that most\npeople would rather wear what looks best over what is most practical. It always\namazes me to see people trying to board a boat at the boat show in high heels or\ntheir work boots! As a detailer, I want to run over to them and tell them just how\nmuch time I’m going to have to spend at 7 a.m. the next morning in freezing cold\ntemperatures scrubbing as hard as I can to remove the black marks they’re about\nto leave!\nTell your friends to wear flat-soled shoes with soles that are light colored or\nnon-marking. Most people will give you a blank stare when you say “non-marking”\nbecause if that’s not the very reason they bought that pair of shoes, they’ll have\nno idea what you’re talking about. If you have teak decks, your greatest enemy is a\nhigh-heeled shoe, whereas with nonskid your greatest enemy is grease marks. Plan\na casual party so that ladies coming from the office or your buddies coming from\nClem’s Auto Lube will feel more comfortable changing into sneakers.\nHow Things Work\nYour friends will board your boat and tell you that your kitchen is cute, will ask\nwhere the bathroom is, and will want to go upstairs so they can see the view from\n\nCruising with Your Non-Boating Friends 159\nthe second floor. Your guy buddies will want to help you with the ropes and bum-\npers, and your lady friends will want to check out all those cute little bedrooms.\nThat’s fine. Let them speak as they will. But before you set sail, you should give\nthem a quick tour of the boat, pointing out the things they may need to find or use\nonce you’ve left the dock.\nThe three most important things you’ll want to point out are how to use the\nhead, how to access fresh water, and how to safely move about the boat. The best\nway to provide directions on how to use the head is to have a small plaque with\nsimple instructions engraved on it and post it in the head. If you gather your friends\naround the head and tell them how to use it, chances are they won’t remember\nmuch of what you say because they’ll feel so silly that you have to show them how\na toilet works at their age. By having a plaque, they won’t have to remember any\ndetails and can simply follow it step-by-step when they need it most. You will still\nfind your head clogged with all sorts of random objects when you get back to the\ndock and your friends are long gone. You’ll wonder what strange rituals went on\nwhile you were at the helm, and where did the plaque go?\nShow your friends how to access fresh drinking water or where you keep the\nwater bottles. Let them know what can and can’t go down the drain and where the\ngarbage can is. Keep extra garbage can liners and paper towels on the counters\nso, in case of spills or the garbage can fills up halfway through the cruise, people\naren’t forced to get creative or fend for themselves. (Trust me, the last thing you\nwant is for your non-boater friends to “get creative”!) Show your guests how to turn\nlights on and off but do not show them where the panel is with all of the neat-look-\ning switches. If this is your only way of turning lights on and off, have the lights\nturned on before they arrive. You do not want your engineering buddies playing\nwith those switches! They will surely think they can re-wire them so you can get\nfree cable TV when you turn on the bilge pump.\nMoving Objects\nBefore your cruise is under way, show your guests the easiest ways to get about\nyour boat, from the aft deck to the bow and up to the flybridge. It’s easier to quickly\ndemonstrate to your guests how to properly navigate stairways and ladders than it\nis to get blood out of teak. In your grand tour, point out handrails and places they\nmay not want to venture if the water gets too choppy lest they get sprayed or lose\ntheir balance.\n\n160 Cruising with Your Non-Boating Friends\nProvide rubber placemats and suctioned cup holders so they have a place to\nput their drinks and snacks; otherwise, you will be cleaning up crumbs from “the\nspill of ‘08” a year from now. This is another reason to leave the paper towels in\nplain view—in case that crab dip goes sailing off the table into their laps.\nMany people are affected by seasickness, or at least think they are. It’s often\nmore of a psychological issue, but if you can help your friends feel comfortable\nbefore you leave the dock, everyone will have a better experience on the water. You\nmay not want to bring up the subject lest you get everyone thinking about it, but\nyou might consider leaving a few bowls of sugared ginger for your friends to snack\non, subtly letting them know of its handy side benefit.\nPut a small container in a cabinet (in the head or galley) with a label marked\n“motion sickness prevention—help yourself” and fill it with seasickness tabs and\nmotion sickness wristbands. If any of your guests start to match the color of their\nseafoam green argyle sweater, encourage them to go outside and get some fresh\nair or lie down inside on the aft berth. If someone does get sick, assure them that\nmost boaters have experienced this at one time or another and by the time they’ve\ngotten it all out of their system and they’re simply praying for death, you’ll be back\nat the dock and all of the moving about will be over.\nBy providing your non-boating friends with information that will make their\nboat ride as comfortable as possible, you’ll be helping them enjoy their experi-\nence, and you’ll ensure that they’ll want another boat ride in the future when their\nfriends from the Midwest are in town.

She took time off from the\ncompany to get a business degree at the Uni-\nversity of Washington and became a market-\ning manager at Microsoft. After a few years in\nthe corporate world, she was ready to get back\nto working on boats and started up her detail-\ning compa ny aga in in 2002. A lt hough she\ndidn’t grow up on or around boats (in fact, she’s\nscared of water), she is an entrepreneur at heart\nand developed a passion for working on them\nand taking care of them. When not working on\na boat, Natalie can be found riding her horse or\nrelaxing at her cabin in the mountains in east-\nern Washington.",
